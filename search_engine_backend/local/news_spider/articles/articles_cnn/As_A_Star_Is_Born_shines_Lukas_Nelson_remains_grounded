As 'A Star Is Born' shines, Lukas Nelson remains grounded|http://cnn.com/entertainment|http://cnn.com/2018/10/12/entertainment/lukas-nelson-a-star-is-born/index.html||2018-10-12|Sandra Gonzalez||&quot;I couldn&#39;t be better,&quot; he says over the phone, with an enthusiasm that displays how true his statement is. &quot;Honestly, the last minute has been especially great. The last, last minute of my life has been just fantastic. So it&#39;s just incredible.&quot;

He declines to share more about those very important, very exciting-seeming 60 seconds of his life when prompted. He says he&#39;s not at liberty to say more, out of respect for the privacy of his friends.

But Nelson has had a lot to be thrilled about these days.

Ever since Bradley Cooper saw Nelson and his band, Promise of the Real, performing with Neil Young at 2016&#39;s Desert Trip, Nelson has been in a whirlwind of good fortune. The latest chapter being last week&#39;s release of &quot;A Star Is Born,&quot; a film for which Nelson helped write songs and coached Cooper, who plays a grizzled rock star named Jackson Maine in the film. (Nelson and his band appear as Maine&#39;s band, too.)

Nelson was there as Cooper went through different &quot;iterations&quot; of his character, eventually landing on the wounded showman who ended up on screen. There&#39;s a little bit of Neil Young in Jackson Maine, and a little bit of Nelson. (&quot;I think he took a few mannerisms from me, frankly,&quot; he says, almost trying to not sound vain.)

Rave early reviews for &quot;A Star Is Born&quot; -- accompanied by a trail of Oscar buzz -- helped propel the film to an impressive opening weekend and its soundtrack, on which Nelson has credits for songs like &quot;Out of Time&quot; and &quot;Music to My Eyes,&quot; is a chart-topper

&quot;That was like the highlight of my life at that point,&quot; Nelson says of being singled out by Cooper from an all-star lineup at what he lovingly refers to as &quot;Oldchella.&quot; &quot;And then, you know, another sort of highlight was born from that.&quot;

Before that, life hadn&#39;t been too shabby either, Nelson said.

He and his band, who&#39;ve been together for more than a decade, have been on the road with his dad, Willie Nelson, and Young.

&quot;This has been happening the last few years and it&#39;s just been a magical sort of dream ride for me and the band,&quot; he said. &quot;It&#39;s just been incredible.&quot;

Nelson&#39;s family, including his dad, were among those who rushed out to see the film after its release.

After they went as a group, they called him &quot;and said everybody was crying,&quot; Nelson says.

That is not an uncommon result of watching &quot;A Star Is Born.&quot;

The story, starring Cooper and Lady Gaga, is part romance, part family drama, part cautionary tale.

The 29-year-old related to some aspects of the tale more than others, but recognized and appreciated the truth of the story as a whole.

&quot;There are a lot of trap doors you can fall into when you get to that level of fame,&quot; Nelson says. &quot;There&#39;s a lot of energy flying at you at all times and you have to be really strong in order to keep your center throughout.&quot;

He adds: &quot;To me it really showcases the struggle to sort of stay grounded, stay who you are, have something to say and be an entertainer in a world that just kind of eats people up within that -- that would eat you up if you&#39;re not careful.&quot;

Nelson speaks like a guy who would fight -- and perhaps has fought -- like hell not to get eaten.

He says he did a lot of reading while growing up and has studied &quot;all different types of spiritualities.&quot; He also meditates, does yoga and has a deep passion for learning.

&quot;I think that if you stopped growing and learning in life, then you might as well die,&quot; he says. &quot;I&#39;m never gonna stop learning about the world around me in all different ways, and I think that keeps me grounded because if you&#39;re always a student, then you can never be mistake yourself for a master and then get of caught up in the ego of things.&quot;

Lukas Nelson and the Promise of the Real

Growing up the son of a music legend, Nelson has been around fame his whole life. This, he says, helps him see famous people -- even the Coopers and Lady Gagas of the world -- in a different light than most.

&quot;Ultimately the only thing that [brings] successful entertainers together is just complete dedication and hard work and focus -- focus on their craft,&quot; he says. &quot;So to put someone on a pedestal as being more than life -- larger than life -- is a mistake when you&#39;re hanging out with them because then people feel like they have a pressure to sort of be someone that they&#39;re not when they&#39;re with you. Most people just want to be able to relax and not have to talk about themselves.&quot;

Through the end of the year, Nelson and his band have tour dates taking them everywhere from Los Angeles -- for a big show as part of the Outlaw Music Festival tour -- to Florida and Texas.

They&#39;re ready, however, to perform music from the movie for a crowd should their talents be needed as award season ramps up.

&quot;I&#39;ve let Bradley and Warner Bros. know the band was ready to do whatever we need to do, if we need to do it,&quot; he said.

Cooper has been more tepid on the idea of resurrecting Jackson Maine for a live audience, I tell him.

&quot;Well, I&#39;ll put in a good word, let&#39;s just say that,&quot; he says.
