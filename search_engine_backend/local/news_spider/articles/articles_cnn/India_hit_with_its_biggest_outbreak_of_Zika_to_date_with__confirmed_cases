New Delhi (CNN) India has recorded its biggest outbreak of Zika virus to date, with 32 cases confirmed in Jaipur, capital of the western state of Rajasthan.

The first case was confirmed on September 23 in the city's Shastri Nagar area, located close to some of the city's main tourist attractions.

The country's health minister, JP Nadda, has deployed a seven-member team to Jaipur to continually monitor the situation and assist with control and containment operations.

The number of suspected cases cannot be estimated, said Veenu Gupta, the Additional Chief Secretary of the Medical and Health & Family Welfare Department for the state, adding that samples are being collected daily from all residents in a three kilometer radius. "Those who test positive are reported."

Those suspected to have contracted the virus are currently being tested. Mosquito samples from the area will also be examined.
