Dressed in a black shirt with the logo of the sporting event he helped to kick start in 2014, the British royal ascended the 134 meter (439 foot) high landmark in beautifully sunny weather, accompanied by Australia&#39;s Prime Minister Scott Morrison.

It will be the fourth time the annual games have been held. The Invictus Games are a multi-sport event specifically held for wounded or disabled veterans to participate in.
