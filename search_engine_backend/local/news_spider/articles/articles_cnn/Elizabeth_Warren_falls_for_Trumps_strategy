Warren released a video that is in many ways extremely compelling. Drawing on Jimmy Carter&#39;s famous biographical campaign film in 1976 that helped to distinguish him based on his upbringing, Warren reveals to Americans how she is a genuine product of the &quot;ragged edge of the middle class&quot; that struggles every day to make ends meet in middle America.

If the question of the 2020 presidential campaign ends up coming down to which candidate has a better understanding for the hopes, struggles and pains of average Americans, the video effectively suggests, it would be Warren as opposed to a President whose wealth was inherited and whose financial success came from shady tax practices. In the video, Warren also hits hard at the kind of racism that has influenced many of Trump&#39;s attacks, standing as a defender for Native Americans who have become the victims of the &quot;blood sport&quot; of politics.
