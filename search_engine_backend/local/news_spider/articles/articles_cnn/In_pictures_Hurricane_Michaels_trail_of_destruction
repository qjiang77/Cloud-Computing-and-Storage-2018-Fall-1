Evan Vucci/AP President Donald Trump, first lady Melania Trump and Florida Gov. Rick Scott tour a Lynn Haven, Florida, neighborhood that was affected by Hurricane Michael.

Hurricane Michael slammed into Florida on Wednesday, October 10, as a Category 4 hurricane, with maximum sustained winds of 155 mph.

&quot;This is the worst storm that our Florida Panhandle has seen in a century,&quot; Gov. Rick Scott said.

Michael was the strongest storm to make landfall in the continental United States since Hurricane Andrew in 1992.

The storm swept through Alabama, Georgia and the Carolinas before moving off Virginia&#39;s coast.
