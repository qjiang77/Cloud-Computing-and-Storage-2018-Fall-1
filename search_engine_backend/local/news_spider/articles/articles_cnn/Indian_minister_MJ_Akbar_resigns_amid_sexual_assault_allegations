Indian minister MJ Akbar resigns amid sexual assault allegations|http://cnn.com/asia|http://cnn.com/2018/10/17/asia/mj-akbar-resignation-metoo-india-intl/index.html||2018-10-17|Swati Gupta||New Delhi (CNN) A series of allegations of sexual harassment and assault has prompted the resignation of an Indian government minister, the most prominent public figure named in the country&#39;s own #MeToo movement.

Facing allegations of groping, assault and harassment from former female colleagues, MJ Akbar, junior minister for foreign affairs, said he had decided to resign and challenge what he labeled &quot;false accusations.&quot;

&quot;Since I have decided to seek justice in a court of law in my personal capacity, I deem it appropriate to step down from office and challenge false accusations levied against me, also in a personal capacity,&quot; he said.

Akbar, a former influential newspaper editor, left office after initially refusing to step down amid the wave of accusations in recent days.

Over the weekend, Akbar rejected growing calls to step aside, dismissing the allegations as false and vowing to go to the courts to clear his name, which he did Monday, suing the first of his accusers for defamation.

Then-journalist MJ Akbar participates in a debate at a literature festival in 2011.
