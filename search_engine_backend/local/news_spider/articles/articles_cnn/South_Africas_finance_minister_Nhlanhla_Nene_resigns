South Africa's finance minister Nhlanhla Nene resigns|http://cnn.com/africa|http://cnn.com/2018/10/09/africa/south-african-finance-minister-resigns/index.html||2018-10-09|David Mckenzie||Johannesburg (CNN) South African President Cyril Ramaphosa accepted the resignation of the country's finance minister Nhlanhla Nene on Tuesday, following what the President described as "errors of judgement."

In a nationally televised address, Ramaphosa said he accepted Nene's resignation because of "errors of judgment" as a result of a controversy surrounding Nene's testimony in an ongoing graft inquiry in South Africa.

Ramaphosa announced that Tito Mboweni, a former South African Reserve Bank Governor, will replace Nene as finance minister.

Mboweni was sworn-in immediately following the address.

"After due consideration of the circumstances around this matter and in the interest of good governance, I have decided to accept his resignation," said Ramaphosa.
