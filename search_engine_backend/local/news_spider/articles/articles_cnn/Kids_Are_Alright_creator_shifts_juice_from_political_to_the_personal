'Kids Are Alright' creator shifts 'juice' from political to the personal|http://cnn.com/entertainment|http://cnn.com/2018/10/17/entertainment/tim-doyle-interview/index.html||2018-10-17|Brian Lowry||(CNN) As a sitcom producer, Tim Doyle has a history of leaning into hot-button issues. He masterminded the &quot;Ellen&quot; coming-out episode in the late &#39;90s, and helped bring Tim Allen&#39;s conservative politics into &quot;Last Man Standing.&quot;

Still, his new ABC show -- &quot;The Kids Are Alright,&quot; a semi-autobiographical comedy looking back on his childhood, set during the summer of 1972 -- has essentially been strictly controversy-adjacent, having landed the time slot after &quot;Roseanne,&quot; before it was canceled and then revived as &quot;The Conners.&quot;

One of the best-regarded pilots of the new TV season, &quot;Kids&quot; does touch on politics, with references to the Nixon administration, and an &quot;All in the Family&quot;-like divide between the oldest of the kids and their gruff, conservative father, played by &quot;The Walking Dead&#39;s&quot; Michael Cudlitz.

The main thrust of the show, though, deals with &quot;The Wonder Years&quot;-like experience of Timmy (Jack Gore) -- an alter ego for Doyle, who also narrates the show -- as one of eight brothers growing up in a Irish-Catholic family during the &#39;70s.

Asked about the political parallels between then and now, Doyle noted that they would come up, as they do in the pilot, but that the focus would primarily be on the kids as they navigate the summer months, while their parents deal with the chaos of having them out of school.
