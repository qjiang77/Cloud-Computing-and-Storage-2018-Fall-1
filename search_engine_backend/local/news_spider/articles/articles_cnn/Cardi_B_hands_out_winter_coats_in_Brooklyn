The rapper handed out free winter coats in Brooklyn, New York on Thursday, where a massive crowd swarmed the &quot;I Like It&quot; performer.

Cardi B, a native of the Bronx, was seen at The Marlboro Houses, a housing project in Gravesend, New York. Her good deed comes as New York was hit with unusually cold temperatures this week.
