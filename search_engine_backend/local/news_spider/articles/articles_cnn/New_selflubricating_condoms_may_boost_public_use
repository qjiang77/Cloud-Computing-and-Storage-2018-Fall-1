New self-lubricating condoms may boost public use|http://cnn.com/health|http://cnn.com/2018/10/17/health/condoms-self-lubricating-prevent-stds-intl/index.html||2018-10-17|Bianca Britton||(CNN) Self-lubricating condoms may be the answer in helping prevent sexually transmitted infections and unplanned pregnancies, researchers have found.

In a step away from the traditional water- or oil-based condoms currently on the market, a team of scientists from Boston University has created a condom that is self-lubricating, becoming slippery when it comes into contact with moisture -- for example, bodily fluids.

The team assessed the performance of the condoms when faced with friction and then surveyed 33 people who felt the condoms to get their opinions on whether they would use them.

Their study found that the majority of people surveyed -- 73% -- not only preferred the feel of the condoms to those currently available but also said it would increase their condom use.

The study size was small and the new condoms have yet to be tested during sex, but researchers hope to start a clinical trial soon.
