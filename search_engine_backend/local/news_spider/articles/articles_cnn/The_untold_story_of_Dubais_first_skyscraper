Before the Burj Khalifa, before the Burj Al Arab, there was the Dubai World Trade Centre.

Completed in 1979, it ruled the city&#39;s skyline as a towering statement of intent; a symbol of Dubai&#39;s ambitions as a regional financial center and rising economic force. Thirty-nine stories and 489 feet high, at the time it was the tallest building between Mumbai and Athens, according to the centre&#39;s former director and first employee Guy Guillemard.

From wild rumors the tower wasn&#39;t straight to questions over why builders had to wash beach sand for its construction, the Dubai World Trade Centre has an interesting and little-known backstory. Now, thanks to a modern heritage initiative by Dubai Municipality, the city&#39;s most venerable high-rise is to be preserved to ensure its protection.

Watch the video above to learn about the skyscraper that started it all for Dubai.
