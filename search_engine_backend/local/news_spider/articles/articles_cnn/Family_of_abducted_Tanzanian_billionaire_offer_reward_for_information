Family of abducted Tanzanian billionaire offer reward for information|http://cnn.com/africa|http://cnn.com/2018/10/15/africa/family-of-kidnapped-africa-billionaire-offer-reward/index.html||2018-10-15|Bukola Adebayo,For Cnn||(CNN) The family of Africa&#39;s youngest billionaire who was kidnapped last week have offered a reward of one billion shillings ($440,000) for information leading to his rescue.

Tanzanian tycoon Mohammed Dewji, 43, was seized by two gunmen as he left the gym of the Colosseum Hotel in Dar es Salaam last Thursday.

Police said the abductors, who are believed to be foreign nationals, drove into the hotel in the Tanzanian capital and opened fire before bundling Dewji into a car and speeding off.

The kidnappers entered the gym through hotel gates police believe were left open deliberately.

The motive for the kidnapping is still unknown. Police told CNN Monday they have yet to receive a ransom demand for the young billionaire. Around 20 men have been arrested in connection with the incident, they added.
