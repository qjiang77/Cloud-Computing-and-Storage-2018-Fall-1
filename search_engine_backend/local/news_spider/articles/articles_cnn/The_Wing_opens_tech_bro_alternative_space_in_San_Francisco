The Wing opens 'tech bro alternative' space in San Francisco|http://cnn.com/business|http://cnn.com/2018/10/09/tech/the-wing-san-francisco/index.html||2018-10-09|Sara Ashley O'Brien,Cnn Business||New York (CNN) The Wing, a women-focused club and coworking community, is headed to the West Coast.

The startup is opening the doors to a fifth location -- and its first in San Francisco's Financial District.

The two-year-old company provides a space for women to work, eat, attend talks and take meetings for a $2,350 annual fee. (For the sake of socioeconomic inclusiveness, The Wing recently launched a "scholarship" program for women who can't afford the cost.)

San Francisco is a notable move for the startup given the Bay Area is known for being home to the predominantly male-run tech industry.

"A lot of what we hear from women in San Francisco is that it is hard to get into the room where decisions are made.

"There's definitely a tech bro culture here -- and we're trying to provide an alternative to that."
