He did, however, have plenty to say about the state of the country, which he theorized may be in the midst of its most polarizing times &quot;perhaps since the civil war.&quot;

The 67-year-old, however, described himself as an &quot;optimist.&quot; Still, he asked of Goodwin: &quot;How do we get out of this?&quot; (Goodwin said she believes active citizens and &quot;movements&quot; can be the difference and change the tides.)

Iger has plenty on his plate without a presidential run in the works.

In addition to the merger with 21st Century Fox, Disney is preparing to enter the streaming wars.

Neither of those subjects came up much during his half-hour conversation with Goodwin, but Iger did show the first footage from the upcoming live-action version of &quot;Lion King.&quot;

&quot;It gives me chills,&quot; Iger said after the clip. &quot;It&#39;s why I feel so optimistic I think.&quot;
