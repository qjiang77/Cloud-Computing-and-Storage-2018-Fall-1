The meeting between Trump and Kanye was high-octane foolishness and one of many debasing moments in Trump&#39;s circus-like White House. As people are fighting for their lives while enduring Hurricane Michael, which should have been the focus this week, we instead have two fame-obsessed, thin-skinned celebrities gushing over each other.

There are claims that Trump is exploiting Kanye West, who has admitted to having mental health issues, by inviting the press to witness his gesticulating and f-bomb throwing in the Oval Office.

While Trump is known for exploiting any and everything -- even the September 11th terrorist attacks -- Kanye West is no victim. Moreover, it is wildly offensive to conflate having mental health issues and displaying erratic behavior with being a willfully ignorant man-child, which is what Kanye West has become. Mental health struggles have nothing to with one&#39;s political beliefs. In addition, a black celebrity worshipping a raging bigot is nothing new -- simply revisit Sammy Davis Jr.&#39;s history with President Richard Nixon
