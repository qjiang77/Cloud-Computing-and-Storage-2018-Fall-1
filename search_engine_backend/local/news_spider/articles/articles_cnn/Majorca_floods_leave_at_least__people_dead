Six of the victims were Spanish, with two British, two German and one Dutch citizen also among the victims, a spokesman for Spain's Guardia Civil said Thursday. A 12th victim remains unidentified.

A rise in the death toll "remains a possibility," the spokesman added.

Five of the deaths occurred in the Sant Llorenç area, about 35 miles east of the Balearic island's capital, Palma, the regional government said Wednesday.

Others have been confirmed in the areas of S'illot, a small coastal town southeast of Sant Llorenç, and Artà, further to the north, the emergency services said.
