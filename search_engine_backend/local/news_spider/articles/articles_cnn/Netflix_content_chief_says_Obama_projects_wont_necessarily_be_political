Netflix content chief says Obama projects won't necessarily be political|http://cnn.com/entertainment|http://cnn.com/2018/10/09/media/obamas-netflix/index.html||2018-10-09|Sandra Gonzalez||(CNN) Netflix Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos didn&#39;t have a lot of details to offer on the projects being prepped by Barack and Michelle Obama for his streaming service but indicated that the content won&#39;t necessarily be &quot;political.&quot;

&quot;They want to do storytelling that is fitting with the things [they] have done with the presidency, obviously, but [also] the experiences they&#39;ve had throughout their entire lives,&quot; Sarandos told the crowd at Vanity Fair&#39;s New Establishment Summit on Tuesday.

Sarandos said the content will hit on subjects like sports, lifestyle and nutrition. Echoing the information shared in the deal&#39;s original announcement, Sarandos said the former president and first lady have &quot;got their eyes on film and television, fiction and nonfiction.&quot;

The Obamas deal with the streaming giant was formally announced back in May.
