43-year-old Mia West was reported as missing since October 7.

According to the LPSO, on Saturday, October 13, a farmer who was harvesting sugar cane in a field along Hwy 307 found an abandoned car. The car was several hundred yards from the highway. At the scene, detectives determined that the car was West’s Nissan Altima.

Deputies began searching the area for any sign of West. The Jefferson Parish Sheriff’s Office responded with one of its helicopters to help.
