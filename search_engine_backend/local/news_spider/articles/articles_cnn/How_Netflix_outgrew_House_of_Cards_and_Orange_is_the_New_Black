How Netflix outgrew 'House of Cards' and 'Orange is the New Black'|http://cnn.com/entertainment|http://cnn.com/2018/10/18/entertainment/netflix-finales/index.html||2018-10-18|Brian Lowry||(CNN) &quot;House of Cards&quot; and &quot;Orange is the New Black&quot; both premiered in 2013, almost instantly putting Netflix on the map as an original-programming option, awards contender and pop-culture powerhouse. While the company hasn&#39;t outgrown them, exactly, as these signature series come to an end, it&#39;s clear that its remarkable growth has rendered each a bit of an afterthought.

Netflix confirmed Wednesday that the upcoming seventh season of &quot;Orange is the New Black&quot; will be the final one, an announcement that comes a few weeks before &quot;House of Cards&quot; begins its last season. While the circumstances are quite different -- the latter had its lifespan truncated by the scandal that engulfed star Kevin Spacey , triggering his exit -- the fact that such a twin loss represents a mere blip is a sign of just how far the streaming service has come in a relatively short time.

As it happens, the &quot;Orange&quot; news came after Netflix disclosed that it had added 7 million subscribers during the most recent quarter, bringing its global tally to 137 million. Earlier this year, the company broke HBO&#39;s stranglehold on the Emmy Awards -- first by ending its 21st-century-long streak as the most-nominated network, then by tying in terms of awards overall.

Notably, that milestone came without help from one-time nominees &quot;House of Cards,&quot; which didn&#39;t air during the eligibility window; and &quot;Orange,&quot; which did, but having lost several steps creatively, no longer garnered much recognition.

Other shows, however, filled the void, as Netflix has added series at a dizzying pace. HBO, in fact -- the longtime award kingpin -- actually characterized itself as a plucky underdog, citing the sheer volume of contenders that Netflix generated as evidence of HBO&#39;s qualitative advantage.
