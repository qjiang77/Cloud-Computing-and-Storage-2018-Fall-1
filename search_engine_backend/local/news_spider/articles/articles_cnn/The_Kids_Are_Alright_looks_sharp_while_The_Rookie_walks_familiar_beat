'The Kids Are Alright' looks sharp, while 'The Rookie' walks familiar beat|http://cnn.com/entertainment|http://cnn.com/2018/10/16/culture/the-kids-are-alright-the-rookie-review/index.html||2018-10-16|Brian Lowry||(CNN) ABC built its Tuesday lineup around &quot;Roseanne,&quot; then had to call an audible -- and transform that into &quot;The Conners&quot; -- to salvage those plans. How well that procedure works will become clear this week, as the show makes its debut along with two new series, &quot;The Kids Are Alright&quot; and &quot;The Rookie.&quot;

&quot;The Kids Are Alright&quot; is a terribly generic name for a surprisingly distinctive and personal sitcom, plucked from the memories of series creator Tim Doyle, about growing up the &quot;needy middle child&quot; in a home filled with eight brothers and their quirky but loving parents. Set in 1972, the Nixon-era echoes add an understated timeliness to an ABC sitcom that will rely on curiosity about a &quot;Roseanne&quot;-less &quot;The Conners&quot; to get sampled.

Doyle&#39;s alter ego, Timmy Cleary (Jack Gore), is 12 years old, an aspiring theater kid in a house where the sheer number of kids fosters an almost Darwinian struggle for survival in this Irish-Catholic clan. &quot;We do not have the wherewithal in this family for any of you kids to be special,&quot; the mom (Mary McCormack) says, while their taciturn dad (&quot;The Walking Dead&#39;s&quot; Michael Cudlitz) seems in step with Archie Bunker in terms of his politics.

The gist of &quot;Kids Are Alright&quot; is that the series (narrated by Doyle) takes place during the summer, when the boys have &quot;no supervision&quot; and are more likely to get into trouble. In Tim&#39;s case, that includes wanting to try out for a production of &quot;Man of La Mancha,&quot; despite his parents&#39; skepticism about such an endeavor, while the family is thrown into turmoil when the oldest brother (Sam Straley) comes home, announcing -- shades of &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; -- that he intends to quit the seminary.

Writers are often told to write what they know, only to yield series that stumble over their self-indulgence. Happily, &quot;Kids&quot; has the feel of something steeped in Doyle&#39;s recollections but that&#39;s universal in many respects, owing a debt to shows like &quot;The Wonder Years,&quot; where the parents&#39; grudging affection masks deeper feelings that their generation wasn&#39;t inclined to openly share.
