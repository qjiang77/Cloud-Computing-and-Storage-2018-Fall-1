After Michael, the skies cleared and the Gulf waters calmed once again. But the full extent of the devastation wrought by the Category 4 storm -- the pain, sadness and wreckage -- is only now coming to light.

Tampa Bay Times photographer Bronte Wittpenn sent a camera-equipped drone over the area of Michael&#39;s ground zero -- Mexico Beach, Florida -- on Friday, October 12, and Saturday, October 13, to let the world see the damage the hurricane inflicted on the region, its people and their way of life.
