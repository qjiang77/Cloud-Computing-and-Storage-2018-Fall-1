Peter Dinklage puts 'My Dinner With Herve' on higher plane|http://cnn.com/entertainment|http://cnn.com/2018/10/19/movies/my-dinner-with-herve-review/index.html||2018-10-19|Brian Lowry||(CNN) The jokey-sounding title does a bit of a disservice to &quot;My Dinner With Herve,&quot; an HBO movie worth seeing solely for &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; star Peter Dinklage&#39;s portrayal of Herve Villechaize. Poignant in places, clunky in others, there are classic &quot;A Star is Born&quot;-esque themes in the &quot;Fantasy Island&quot; second banana&#39;s tragic tale, a treatise on the benefits and toll of life as a public curiosity.

Writer/director Sacha Gervasi (who directed the 2012 film &quot;Hitchcock&quot;) based the screenplay on his own experience as a journalist, when a British newspaper dispatched him to Los Angeles in 1993 to report a number of articles. A tacked-on chat with the diminutive actor felt like the least of those assignments -- one he pleads with his editor to forgo -- but Villechaize promised him &quot;a great story,&quot; then proceeded to deliver.

Alas, approaching the narrative from the skeptical perspective of the journalist -- played by &quot;Fifty Shades of Grey&#39;s&quot; Jamie Dornan -- is easily the weakest part of the piece. Even inspired by Gervasi&#39;s story, the wrinkle that he&#39;s coming out of rehab -- and isn&#39;t helped by watching Villechaize drink excessively, puff on cigars, shuck oysters, brandish a knife, and frequent strip clubs -- plays like a clich√©.

&quot;A life without risks,&quot; Villechaize explains, &quot;is not worth discussing.&quot;

Once Gervasi gets past the prologue, though, and into the meat of Villechaize&#39;s biography, the movie picks up considerably. That includes efforts by his father, a physician, to &quot;cure&quot; him; being treated like a freak growing up in France; and eventually finding work as an actor -- first in the James Bond movie &quot;The Man With the Golden Gun&quot; and later the long-running TV show.
