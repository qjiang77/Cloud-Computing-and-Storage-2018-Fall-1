JPMorgan is building a fintech campus in Silicon Valley|http://cnn.com/business|http://cnn.com/2018/10/19/business/jpmorgan-fintech-office/index.html||2018-10-19|Julia Horowitz,Cnn Business||New York (CNN Business) JPMorgan Chase is building a campus in Silicon Valley as it redoubles its focus on tech â€” and looks to compete more aggressively for top talent.

The bank said Friday that it will open a new &quot;fintech campus&quot; in Palo Alto in 2020. It will house more than 1,000 employees, consolidating the company&#39;s existing presence in the Bay Area.

The move signals JPMorgan&#39;s growing focus on digital payments. In 2017, the bank bought WePay, a payments company that competes with PayPal. Its 275 employees will move to the Palo Alto campus from Redwood City.

And it indicates a commitment to technology more broadly. Roughly 50,000 people at JPMorgan ( JPM ) work in tech. This year&#39;s budget for the division is $10.8 billion, with $5 billion set aside for new investments. That&#39;s up from $9.5 billion in 2017.

A bigger Bay Area location, which the company said will feature &quot;a modern workplace design&quot; and &quot;state-of-the-art technology,&quot; could help JPMorgan compete with tech giants like Google ( GOOGL ) and Facebook ( FB ) for talent.
