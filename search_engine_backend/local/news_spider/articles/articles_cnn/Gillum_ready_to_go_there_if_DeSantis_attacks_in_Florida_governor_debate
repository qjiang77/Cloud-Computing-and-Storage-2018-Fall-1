Gillum ready to 'go there' if DeSantis attacks in Florida governor debate|http://cnn.com/election|http://cnn.com/2018/10/21/politics/florida-governor-debate-gillum-desantis/index.html||2018-10-21|Gregory Krieg||(CNN) Only a few days after making his return to the campaign trail following a hurricane-enforced hiatus, Florida Democrat Andrew Gillum will square off with Republican Ron DeSantis on Sunday night in the first debate of their high stakes gubernatorial race.

CNN&#39;s Jake Tapper will host the one-hour face-to-face beginning at 8 p.m. ET, from the WEDU studios in Tampa. The debate will be broadcast live on CNN.

With only a little more than two weeks now before Election Day, and early voting starting on Monday, DeSantis is likely eyeing the showdown as an opportunity to alter the course of a race he&#39;s consistently trailed in the polls. A new CNN survey conducted by SSRS out Sunday found Gillum with a double-digit lead, 54% to 42%.

At a campaign stop on Friday, Gillum, the young progressive mayor of Tallahassee, predicted the Republican former congressman would hit him low and hard -- then warned he was prepared to return the favor.

&quot;(DeSantis) is going to call me a socialist. He&#39;s going to call me corrupt. He&#39;s going to throw his covered-up versions of racial epithets. He&#39;s going to call me anti-Israel,&quot; Gillum said, comparing his opponent to President Donald Trump, whose endorsement DeSantis rode to victory in the August primary.
