USC says it's tentatively agreed to $215M settlement over gynecologist misconduct claims|http://cnn.com/health|http://cnn.com/2018/10/19/health/usc-gynecologist-george-tyndall-settlement/index.html||2018-10-19|Sara Sidner,Stella Chan,Jason Hanna||(CNN) The University of Southern California said Friday it has &quot;reached agreement in principle&quot; on a $215 million class-action settlement after dozens of students filed lawsuits accusing former campus gynecologist Dr. George Tyndall of sexually abusing them.

The settlement would provide at least $2,500 to &quot;all class members&quot; -- patients who received women&#39;s health services from Tyndall -- interim USC President Wanda Austin said in a statement released Friday.

&quot;Patients who are willing to provide further details about their experience could be eligible for additional compensation up to $250,000,&quot; Austin&#39;s statement reads.

The proposed settlement was &quot;reached with plaintiffs&#39; counsel,&quot; Austin said.

Tyndall served as a gynecologist at the university student health center for nearly 30 years until he was fired in 2017. He has denied any wrongdoing. He is being investigated by law enforcement authorities but has not been charged with any crime.
