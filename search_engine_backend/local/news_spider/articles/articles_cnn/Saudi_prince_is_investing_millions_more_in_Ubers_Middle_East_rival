Saudi prince is investing millions more in Uber's Middle East rival|http://cnn.com/business|http://cnn.com/2018/10/18/tech/saudi-arabia-careem-investment/index.html||2018-10-18|Zahraa Alkhalisi,Cnn Business||Dubai (CNN Business) Uber&#39;s rival in the Middle East just got a big financial boost.

Careem, the ride-hailing app based in Dubai, received $200 million in a funding round led by Saudi Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal.

The investment by his company, Kingdom Holding, values Careem at more than $2 billion, according to a person with knowledge of the deal. That&#39;s up from about $886 million in 2017, when Kingdom Holding bought 7% of Careem.

It comes as Saudi Arabia&#39;s network of business ties and global tech investments comes under intense scrutiny following the unexplained disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. He was last seen entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul more than 2 weeks ago.

Turkish officials have told CNN he was killed inside the consulate. Saudi authorities have so far maintained that Khashoggi left the consulate the same day, but they have provided no evidence to support the claim.
