Trump claims (without evidence) that Dems are behind migrant caravan ahead of midterms|http://cnn.com/americas|http://cnn.com/2018/10/19/politics/donald-trump-migrant-caravan-midterm-elections/index.html||2018-10-19|Sophie Tatum||Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump on Thursday seized on a new migrant caravan approaching the US to frame the midterm elections as a fight over border security while blaming Democrats, without evidence, of supporting the influx.

&quot;It&#39;s going to be an election of the caravan,&quot; Trump said at a campaign rally in Missoula, Montana. &quot;You know what I&#39;m talking about.&quot;

In an extended riff about illegal immigration and the caravan, Trump told the crowd that Democrats were banking on the caravan to arrive before Election Day so they could vote for Democrats -- even though as asylum-seekers, they wouldn&#39;t be citizens and therefore would not be able to vote in the congressional elections.

&quot;As you know, I&#39;m willing to send the military to defend our southern border if necessary, all &#39;cause -- because of the illegal immigration onslaught brought by the Democrats because they refuse to acknowledge or to change the laws,&quot; he said. &quot;They like it. They also figure everybody coming in is going to vote Democrat, you know. Hey, they&#39;re not so stupid when you think about it, right?&quot;

Trump has repeatedly accused the Democrats of wanting &quot;open borders,&quot; though he hasn&#39;t provided evidence for that claim. Although Democrats typically call for more relaxed policies toward undocumented immigrants, major party officials still advocate for some measure of regulation and security at the border. President Barack Obama was dubbed the &quot;deporter in chief&quot; among some immigrant advocacy groups for steps his administration took, and more than 2.4 million people were deported during his administration.
