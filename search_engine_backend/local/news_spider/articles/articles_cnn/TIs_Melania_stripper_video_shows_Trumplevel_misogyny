(CNN) Donald Trump is a piggish, unrepentant misogynist who has demonstrated that he thinks women are only as valuable as their physical appearance, a gutter perspective he made clear again when he called Stormy Daniels &quot;horseface&quot; on Twitter Tuesday. So why in the world would his opponents stoop to his level?

That&#39;s what rapper T.I. did recently in a music video clip he tweeted, in which a Melania Trump lookalike strips in the Oval Office, dancing for T.I.&#39;s pleasure after the President leaves the White House. The point was to stick it to the President. But the means was the same tool the President uses: Misogyny.

T.I.&#39;s message is fairly straightforward: Women are extensions of men, and it is humiliating for a man to have &quot;his&quot; woman stripping for someone else. Sexually objectifying Melania is a shortcut way of demeaning both her and her husband.

That humiliation relies on the same tropes used by Trump: There are &quot;good&quot; women and &quot;bad&quot; women, and a woman being either sexual or insufficiently attractive puts her in the &quot;bad&quot; category; that if you want to demean a woman, paint her as either slutty or ugly.

There are a lot of ways to mock Trump that don&#39;t depend on the same sexist narratives that in a better world would have disgraced this presidency. The T.I. video isn&#39;t one of them.
