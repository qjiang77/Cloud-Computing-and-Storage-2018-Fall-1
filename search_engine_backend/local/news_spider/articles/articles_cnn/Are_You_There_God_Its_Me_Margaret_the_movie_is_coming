It&#39;s Me, Margaret,&quot; she&#39;s agreed to let it be made into a movie.

The book, first published in 1970, is about the life of Margaret Simon, an 11-year-old in the sixth grade, living in Farbrook, New Jersey. Margaret forms a secret club with three girls from her neighborhood and that&#39;s where they talk about typical issues that pre-teens face, from anticipating their periods to first bras and boys.

Margaret also explores questions about faith, while growing up in a home with parents who aren&#39;t affiliated with any religion. She talks to God in the story and begins each prayer by saying, &quot;Are you there God? It&#39;s me, Margaret.&quot;

Blume has granted the highly sought after rights to producer James L. Brooks and Kelly Fremon Craig. Brooks and Craig both spoke about the news to Deadline

Craig wrote and directed the 2016 coming of age film, &quot;The Edge Of Seventeen.&quot;
