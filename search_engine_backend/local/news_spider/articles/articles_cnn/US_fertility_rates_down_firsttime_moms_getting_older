Total fertility rates fell 12% in rural, 16% in suburban and 18% in urban counties over a decade

(CNN) First-time mothers in the United States grew older on average over the past decade while total fertility rates declined, a new government report shows.

The average age of new mothers increased between 2007 and 2017, according to the data brief from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&#39;s National Center for Health Statistics, published Wednesday.

In that time period, new moms in rural areas grew older by 1.3 years, in suburban areas by 1.5 years and in urban areas by 1.8 years. First-time mothers in rural counties were younger, on average, than their counterparts in more urban regions for each of the years within the time span studied.

For example, first-time mothers in rural counties averaged 23.2 years of age in 2007 and 24.5 years in 2017. By comparison, the average age of suburban new moms was 24.3 years in 2007 and 25.8 years in 2017, while urban moms were 25.9 and 27.7 years old on average.

This general trend of older first-time moms held true across all races.
