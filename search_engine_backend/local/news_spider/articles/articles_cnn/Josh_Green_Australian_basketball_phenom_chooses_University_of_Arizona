Josh Green: Australian basketball phenom chooses University of Arizona|http://cnn.com/australia|http://cnn.com/2018/10/05/sport/josh-green-commits-to-university-of-arizona-int-sptl/index.html||2018-10-05|Motez Bishara||Story highlights 17-year-old is top Aussie high school prospect

Follows former NBA No. 1 pick Ben Simmons

Plays at IMG Academy in Florida

(CNN) Australian high school basketball sensation Josh Green joined top prospect Nico Mannion in committing to the University of Arizona despite an ongoing FBI investigation into player recruitment.

The 6-foot 6-inch guard had been highly sought after by the likes of Villanova, North Carolina and Kansas, but made his decision public via social media Thursday.

The 17-year-old Green is coming off a torn labrum sustained in his shoulder in July, but is expected to recover in time for his senior year at the IMG Academy in Florida.

He could replicate the path of fellow Australian Ben Simmons, a highly touted freshman at LSU who was picked No. 1 in the 2016 NBA draft -- though Green is deflecting similarities.

&quot;The only comparison is we&#39;re Australian and we&#39;re playmakers,&quot; Green recently told Bleacher Report. &quot;Some of the stuff he can do, I can&#39;t do, and the same thing goes the other way.
