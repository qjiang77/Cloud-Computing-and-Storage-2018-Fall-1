'Halloween': Why horror films make a killing at the box office|http://cnn.com/business|http://cnn.com/2018/10/19/media/halloween-box-office-analysis/index.html||2018-10-19|Frank Pallotta,Cnn Business||&quot;Horror really is the easiest sell,&quot; film critic Amy Nicholson told CNN Business. Nicholson is the host of The Ringer&#39;s &quot; Halloween Unmasked ,&quot; an eight-part podcast series about the making and cultural impact of the franchise.

&quot;You could say, &#39;with this film I&#39;m going to try to make you laugh&#39; and that may not work for everybody. People have different senses of humor,&quot; she said. &quot;But if you say, &#39;here&#39;s a movie that&#39;s going to make you cringe,&#39; that&#39;s going to hit a much broader swath of people.&quot;

Neither of these recent blockbusters compare to the original &quot;Halloween,&quot; which was made for just $300,000 in 1978 and brought back $60 million , or 200 times its costs.

Jeff Bock, senior box office analyst at &quot;You don&#39;t need stars, you don&#39;t need huge name directors,&quot;Jeff Bock, senior box office analyst at Exhibitor Relations , told CNN Business. &quot;There&#39;s not a lot of risk when you&#39;re talking about horror films.&quot;

Horror is a genre that is ideal to watch in the theater because there&#39;s &quot;something contagious about fear,&quot; according to Caetlin Benson-Allott, an associate professor at Georgetown University who specializes in new media&#39;s impact on film.

&quot;In academia, we use the term &#39;affect&#39; to describe an emotional intensity that&#39;s shared among people, that&#39;s not just an individual&#39;s internal emotion,&quot; Benson-Allott told CNN Business. &quot;Horror movies are a perfect example of &#39;affect&#39; at work. When I hear the other people screaming in the theater with me, it amplifies my response.&quot;

Jason Blum -- the CEO of Blumhouse Productions, which backed &quot;Halloween,&quot; &quot;Get Out&quot; and &quot;The Purge&quot; -- told CNN Business that no genre has been spared from being cannibalized by streaming services. But &quot;horror is certainly more immune than other genres.&quot;

Blum explained that filmmakers who don&#39;t typically make horror movies are suddenly eager to make a great horror film, largely because &quot;they know the theatrical experience will be preserved&quot; since &quot;the genre works really well in movie theaters.&quot; Great examples of this are &quot;Get Out&quot; director Jordan Peele and &quot;A Quiet Place&quot; director John Krasinski, two comedic actors who created hit horror films in recent years.

Another reason horror is having a moment right now is because its fictional stories might be more comforting than what&#39;s happening in the real world.

&quot;I think it&#39;s because the world is a particularly scary place. It&#39;s nice to go somewhere to see something that&#39;s scary, that&#39;s not real,&quot; Blum said. &quot;I think it&#39;s as simple as that.&quot;

Nicholson thinks there is reason why &quot;Halloween&quot; is particularly relatable at the moment.

&quot;Michael Myers is, in a way, one of the original angry young men, who is just mad for reasons we can&#39;t comprehend,&quot; she said. &quot;That&#39;s a story we&#39;ve been talking about a lot lately in the news, why are some people just angry and how do we reach them? Michael Myers is a man you can&#39;t reach, and that&#39;s terrifying.&quot;
