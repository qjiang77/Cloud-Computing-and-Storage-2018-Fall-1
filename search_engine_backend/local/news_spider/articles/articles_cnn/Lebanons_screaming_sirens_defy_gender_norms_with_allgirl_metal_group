Lebanon's screaming sirens defy gender norms with all-girl metal group|http://cnn.com/middle-east|http://cnn.com/2018/09/09/middleeast/lebanon-all-girl-metal-band/index.html||2018-09-09|Jane Bracher,Alma Doumani,Slave To Sirens||(CNN) In Greek mythology, sirens use their enchanting voices to lure sailors to their death. In Lebanon, a group of modern-day sirens have decided not to sing sweetly like their namesakes. Instead they scream, growl and headbang -- but they, too, turn heads.

Slave to Sirens are defying gender norms as the first all-female metal band in the country, asserting their place not just in conservative Lebanese society but also in the male-dominated, global heavy metal scene.

The five-piece group, formed in 2016, fearlessly command stages that are usually monopolized by men. Their lyrics -- written in English to reach a wider audience -- express raw feelings and strong opinions on issues of social inequality, politics and freedom.

It&#39;s our right to be on stage and perform as all girls, why would we be less or different from guys?

In the title track of the band&#39;s self-produced debut EP, &quot; Terminal Leeches ,&quot; lead vocalist Maya Khairallah sings: &quot;They fill your head with lies. Ignorance, your ultimate demise.&quot; The lyrics of the closing track, &quot;Congenital Evil,&quot; reinforce the message: &quot;Why do you always have to obey? Zero degrees of empathy, forever coming your way.&quot;

Bassist Alma Doumani, 22, says that for her, the allure of heavy metal is its aggressive style. &quot;It lets your anger out -- it lets you express your mind.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s our right to be on stage and perform as all girls, why would we be less or different from guys?&quot; says Doumani. &quot;It&#39;s not just guys who have talent.&quot;

Defying the norm

Lina Abirafeh, director of the Institute for Women&#39;s Studies in the Arab World, says that in Lebanon, women are frequently objectified. &quot;Ideas of what is feminine, acceptable, beautiful, sexy -- all of those descriptors for women -- are notoriously narrow,&quot; she says, adding that female Lebanese singers are often &quot;overly sexualized, very feminine, very dolled up.&quot; She sees Slave to Sirens as &quot;role models&quot; for breaking that mold.

Change is not being championed at the political level, because women are not well represented -- they currently hold only 3.1% of parliamentary seats . Lebanon also ranks 143rd out of 153 countries in the Women, Peace and Security Index , an assessment of women&#39;s overall well-being within their communities and societies.

Metal in the Middle East

But in Lebanon, the metal scene is largely accepted and most people understand it to be a form of art, according to Elia Mssawir, who helps to organize the annual Beirut Metal Fest

Alma Doumani, the band&#39;s bassist.

He cites an incident when organizers of a metal event in the Lebanese mountains were investigated after villagers &quot;didn&#39;t like what they saw,&quot; but says there have not been any attempts at censorship in the last five years.

While it&#39;s common for metal acts in the region to use music as a platform to express opinion on politics or religion, Mssawir notes that current Lebanese bands largely steer clear from that because they see metal as an &quot;escape&quot; from those everyday realities. Slave to Sirens are among the few that inject those topics into their music.

Beyond metal music

Abirafeh believes that Slave to Sirens&#39; impact will transcend music. &quot;You don&#39;t have to like metal to see that what these women are doing is powerful and courageous,&quot; she says. &quot;It&#39;s about saying that we are going to defy all those rules and norms, and go out there and do what we love.&quot;

&quot;Other girls can also feel like maybe they [want] to do something but they are ashamed or they don&#39;t have the guts,&quot; says Doumani. &quot;Maybe if they see us, they will have the guts to do it.&quot;
