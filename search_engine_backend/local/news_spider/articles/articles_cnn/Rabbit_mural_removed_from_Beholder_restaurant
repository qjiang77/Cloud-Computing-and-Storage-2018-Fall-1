Rabbit mural removed from Beholder restaurant|http://cnn.com/us|https://www.theindychannel.com/news/local-news/indianapolis/east-side/rabbit-mural-removed-from-beholder-restaurant||2018-10-21|Matt Mckinney||INDIANAPOLIS -- And just like that, the rabbit mural is gone.

The controversial mural, painted on the side of the Beholder restaurant on Indy&#39;s east side, was gone by about noon on Friday.

The mural showed two rabbits... multiplying, while one of them smoked a cigarette.

The wall that once housed the mural is now gray. The painter said he was hired by the building&#39;s owner, but he wouldn&#39;t comment beyond that.

On Thursday, many people took photos in front of the mural, but others saw it as a problem.

The restaurant is in a residential area, near a Family Dollar store. Some see that as a problem because children are often in the area.

“I don’t think it should be there because there&#39;s children that come here all the time to Family Dollar,” Devin Stephenson said. “I’d have to explain they’re wrestling.”
