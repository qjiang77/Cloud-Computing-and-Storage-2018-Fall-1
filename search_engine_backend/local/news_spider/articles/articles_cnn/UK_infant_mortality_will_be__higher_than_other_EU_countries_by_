Researchers say the rise is due to higher risk factors in the UK, tied to poverty and inequality

(CNN) Infant mortality in the UK is predicted to be 140% higher than in 15 other European countries by 2030, a new report says.

The mortality rate for infants in Britain rose for the first time in 100 years in 2015 and again in 2016. Deaths rose from 3.6 deaths per 1,000 in 2014 to 3.7 per 1,000 in 2015, then 3.8 per 1,000 deaths in 2016. Previous years had shown a steady decline in infant mortality rates across the UK.

The new report by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health predicts that if the rate of increase stays the same, the UK&#39;s infant mortality will be 140% higher than 15 other European countries within the next 12 years, due to a faster fall of mortality rates elsewhere in Europe.

The lead author of the report, Russell Viner, said this possible outcome is &quot;pretty disastrous.&quot; He added that &quot;this is a warning sign that things need to shift.&quot;

Viner said that the cause of the rise in mortality seen over the past two years is unknown and that it&#39;s not clear whether this is a blip or a sign of a worrying trend.
