Suspect in Maduro assassination plot dies in mysterious fall from window|http://cnn.com/world|http://cnn.com/2018/10/09/americas/venezuela-assassination-plot-intl/index.html||2018-10-09|Mallory Gafas,Joshua Berlinger||(CNN) One of the suspects accused of trying to assassinate Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro using drones armed with explosives died under mysterious circumstances Monday.

Venezuelan government officials say Fernando Alb치n, a 56-year-old city councilor in the capital of Caracas and Maduro critic, died by suicide after jumping out a tenth floor window of the Bolivarian Intelligence Service, the country's top intelligence agency.

But Maduro critics have accused the regime of murdering Alb치n as part of a massive crackdown on opposition groups and human rights activists.

Alb치n was arrested on Friday for his alleged involvement in the apparent assassination attempt on August 4 , when armed drones flew toward Maduro during a speech at a military parade. Two loud explosions were heard and while Maduro escaped the attack unharmed, seven members of Venezuela's national guard were injured.

It's unclear exactly what happened to Alb치n in the time between his arrest and death.
