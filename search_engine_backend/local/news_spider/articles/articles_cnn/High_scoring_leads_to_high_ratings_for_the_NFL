High scoring leads to high ratings for the NFL|http://cnn.com/business|http://cnn.com/2018/10/18/media/nfl-ratings-offense/index.html||2018-10-18|Frank Pallotta,Cnn Business||New York (CNN Business) The NFL&#39;s sluggish ratings were one of the biggest stories in TV for the past two years. The falling numbers weren&#39;t blamed on just one thing: There were concerns over concussions, star players getting hurt nearly every week and, of course, President Trump attacking the league over players kneeling during the National Anthem.

But the ratings are up this year. So what&#39;s going on? Well, again, it&#39;s possible that there are a few different explanations, but there&#39;s likely one reason above all the rest: The NFL is fun to watch again.

Fifty four games this season have been decided by just one score, according to the NFL. That&#39;s tied for the most in league history through week six. Scoring is also on a record pace, with NFL teams having scored 504 touchdowns and 4,489 points, both records this far into a season.

Twenty one of the NFL&#39;s 32 teams are currently in first place or within one game of it, and at least one game has gone to overtime in each of the first six weeks. That&#39;s the first time that&#39;s happened since the league instituted the regular season overtime rule in 1974.
