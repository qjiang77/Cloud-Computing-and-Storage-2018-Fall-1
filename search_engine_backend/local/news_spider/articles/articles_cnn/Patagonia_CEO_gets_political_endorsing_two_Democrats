The outdoor goods and apparel store threw its weight behind two Democratic candidates: Jacky Rosen, who is running for Senate in Nevada, and Senator Jon Tester who is running for re-election in Montana.

Founder Yvon Chouinard added that Tester &quot;is a real advocate for hunters, hikers and Montana&#39;s thriving outdoor economy.&quot;
