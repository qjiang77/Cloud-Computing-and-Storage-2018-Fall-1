'The Romanoffs' pedigree doesn't join ranks of TV royalty|http://cnn.com/entertainment|http://cnn.com/2018/10/11/entertainment/the-romanoffs-review/index.html||2018-10-11|Brian Lowry||(CNN) History might be kinder to &quot;The Romanoffs,&quot; but in the current moment, this loosely connected anthology series looks like a self-indulgent lark -- with &quot;Mad Men&quot; creator Matthew Weiner reveling in the creative latitude all those Emmys earned him, getting Amazon to finance a project whose appeal might be even narrower than students of early 20th-century Russian history.

Basically, the program&#39;s jumping-off point is stories involving people who claim to be heirs to the ill-fated Romanov family, who were slaughtered by Bolsheviks (a sequence dispatched with during the opening credits) as they seized power a century ago.

What emerges, though, are basically independent films -- each running about 90 minutes -- telling stories with a beginning, middle and end, but none (of the three previewed) so distinctive or compelling as to merit lining up to see them.

The format does offer one distinct advantage, helping Weiner (who directed every episode, and wrote or co-wrote six of the eight) attract big-name actors, including a number of &quot;Mad Men&quot; alumni. But the disjointed nature of the approach -- and beyond-wispy thread connecting them -- makes the whole project suffer from an emotional distance, making it difficult to connect.

The first episode is perhaps the strongest, featuring veteran actress Marthe Keller as the imperious matriarch of a Romanov-connected family living in Paris, who chases away every caregiver that her nephew (Aaron Eckhardt) hires for her. That changes when Hajar (Ines Melab) comes into her home, a young Muslim woman who Keller&#39;s character initially abuses, before gradually bonding with her.
