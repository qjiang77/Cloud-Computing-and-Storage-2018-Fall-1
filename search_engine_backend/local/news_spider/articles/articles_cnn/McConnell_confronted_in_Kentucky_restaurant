McConnell confronted in Kentucky restaurant|http://cnn.com/us|http://cnn.com/2018/10/20/politics/mitch-mcconnell-restaurant-protestors/index.html||2018-10-20|Sophie Tatum||Washington (CNN) Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was confronted at a restaurant in Kentucky on Friday, according to CNN affiliate WLKY.

According to WLKY, McConnell, a Republican representing Kentucky, was dining at Havana Rumba in Louisville, Kentucky, with his wife, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, when a group of men approached the couple.

&quot;Why don&#39;t you get out of here? Why don&#39;t you leave the entire country?&quot; one of the men yelled at McConnell, WLKY reported.

&quot;The leader and Secretary Chao enjoyed their meal in Louisville last night and they appreciate those who spoke up against incivility,&quot; said Stephanie Penn, McConnell&#39;s press secretary, in a statement to CNN. &quot;They hope other patrons weren&#39;t too inconvenienced by left-wing tantrums. As the leader often says, the Senate will not be intimidated by the antics of far-left protesters.&quot;

WLKY also reported that McConnell&#39;s to-go box was tossed out the door of the restaurant.
