Michael Dunn was charged Friday with second-degree murder in the Oct. 3 fatal shooting of 50-year-old Cristobal Lopez at a Lakeland, Florida, Army-Navy surplus store that Dunn owns, the Lakeland Police Department said.

He is being held without bond at the Polk County Jail. His first court appearance is set for Saturday morning, a Polk County Sheriff&#39;s Office spokesman said.

Surveillance video from Vets Army Navy Surplus store appears to show Lopez trying to leave as Dunn grabs him by the shirt. Lopez is then seen holding onto the handle of the store front door while Dunn tries to pull him back inside the store.

Dunn, who was holding a firearm in his other hand, lost his grip of Lopez&#39;s shirt and fired two shots, police say.
