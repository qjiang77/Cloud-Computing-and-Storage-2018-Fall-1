The ICRC issued desperate pleas to the Nigerian government to negotiate the release of the workers, adding that, &quot;speed and urgency are critical.&quot;

Aleksandra Matijevic Mosimann, ICRC spokeswoman in Nigeria, told CNN they received an ultimatum from the militants on September 16 when the group also issued a threat against schoolgirl Leah Sharibu , whose parents confirmed to CNN she was &quot;facing a death sentence.&quot;

Mosimann said the ICRC does not negotiate with terrorists but Boko Haram had reached out to them through &quot;credible sources,&quot; about the deadline.
