Washington Post publishes 'last piece' by missing Saudi journalist Khashoggi|http://cnn.com/middle-east|http://cnn.com/2018/10/18/politics/jamal-khashoggi-washington-post-column-intl/index.html||2018-10-18|James Griffiths||(CNN) The Washington Post has published what the newspaper describes as the &quot;last piece&quot; written by missing Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who was allegedly killed and dismembered in his country&#39;s consulate in Istanbul earlier this month.

In a note at the top of the column, published late Wednesday , Post Global Opinions editor Karen Attiah wrote that she &quot;held off publishing it because we hoped Jamal would come back to us.&quot;

&quot;Now I have to accept: That is not going to happen,&quot; she said. &quot;This is the last piece of his I will edit for The Post. This column perfectly captures his commitment and passion for freedom in the Arab world. A freedom he apparently gave his life for.&quot;

In his last Post column before his disappearance, Jamal Khashoggi wrote about the Arab world&#39;s need for a free press. Read it here. https://t.co/L80fitlJZT â€” Washington Post (@washingtonpost) October 18, 2018

In the piece, Khashoggi bemoaned the lack of free expression in the Arab world, leaving the majority of its population &quot;unable to adequately address, much less publicly discuss, matters that affect the region and their day-to-day lives.&quot;

He contrasted the current situation with the sentiment felt by many during the Arab Spring, when they hoped to be &quot;emancipated from the hegemony of their governments and the consistent interventions and censorship of information,&quot; only to have those expectations dashed as revolutions -- both peaceful and violent -- failed or were crushed by outside intervention.
