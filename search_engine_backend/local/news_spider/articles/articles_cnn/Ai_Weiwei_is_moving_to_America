Ai Weiwei is moving to America|http://cnn.com/asia|http://cnn.com/style/article/ai-weiwei-america-interview-los-angeles/index.html||2018-10-16|Nick Watts,Los Angeles,Stephanie Becker||Written by Nick Watts, CNN Los Angeles Contributors Stephanie Becker, CNN

The Chinese conceptual artist and political provocateur knows that with his pro-migrant message he&#39;s swimming against a populist tide. In Europe, right-wing politicians now regularly decry the migrants crossing the Mediterranean from Africa to Europe in overcrowded boats. And in the United States, President Donald Trump, at rabble-rousing rallies, promises to build a border wall to keep Mexican migrants out.

&quot;People forget where they come from,&quot; Ai Weiwei tells me as we perch on stools next to one of his giant installations in a cavernous Los Angeles gallery. It&#39;s a bamboo rendering of an inflatable boat, filled with animal and human figures. They&#39;re refugees. &quot;We all could have difficulty moment,&quot; he says. &quot;And in those moment, we desperately need help.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s why I realize my type of fighting is needed,&quot; says Ai.

Ai has lived and worked in Germany for the past few years, ever since the Chinese government released him from jail and returned his passport . But he is about to move to New York. &quot;Everybody in the United States are refugees, in some time in the history,&quot; he says. &quot;None of them are rooted here, so we should easily understand people are moving, human flow is very basic condition in humanity.&quot;

Ai seemed a little distracted before we started talking, holding up his phone between us as we waited for Jordan, the photographer, to make some final tweaks to the lighting. I thought Ai was reading something on his phone. Turns out he was surreptitiously taking my picture. I only know because someone spotted it later on Ai&#39;s Instagram feed , where he catalogs, and elevates, slivers of the minutiae in his life. He&#39;s a deep-thinking being. His mission is serious and seemingly all-consuming.

This is an artist who these days can afford to just start buying up ancient tea pot shards at a street market in China without any clear idea of what he might do with them. But he&#39;s very keen to make it clear that he&#39;s not a silver spoon kind of guy. &quot;We all start at zero,&quot; he says. &quot;My father didn&#39;t inherit me a penny.&quot; Ai&#39;s artistic journey began in earnest when he came to the US in the 1980s to study. &quot;When I come to the United States, I hold $30 in my hands. I don&#39;t speak English. As a poor student, I started the work as a gardener, carpenter, housekeeping.&quot;

Now he&#39;s one of the most revered contemporary artists on earth, with three nearly simultaneous exhibitions in Los Angeles this fall. And Ai did find a use for those broken, ancient tea pots. They became Spouts: around 300,000 of them, right now arranged in a gigantic rectangle on the floor of the Marciano Art Foundation&#39;s gigantic gallery space . The message? Well, these are symbols of the millions of mouths who could never speak, that would never be heard. His mission? &quot;I do feel a very strong responsibility,&quot; Ai tells me. &quot;Towards those people who never had a chance to speak out.&quot;
