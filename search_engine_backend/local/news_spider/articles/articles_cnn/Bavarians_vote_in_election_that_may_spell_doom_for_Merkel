Bavarians vote in election that may spell doom for Merkel|http://cnn.com/world|http://cnn.com/2018/10/14/europe/bavaria-election-merkel-germany-intl/index.html||2018-10-14|Atika Shubert||Deggendorf, Germany (CNN) Voters in the southern German state of Bavaria were going to the polls on Sunday in a regional election that could shake the fragile coalition of Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin.

Markus Soeder, Governor of Bavaria and lead candidate of the Christian Social Union (CSU), casts his vote in Nuremberg, Germany on Sunday.

The Christian Social Union (CSU) -- a conservative sister party to Merkel's Christian Democrat Union (CDU) -- has dominated Bavarian politics for almost seven decades. Apart from a three-year period in the 1950s, the party has continuously governed the state since 1949.

At this election, however, the CSU could lose votes to the anti-immigration, far-right Alternative for Deutschland (AfD) party and to the left-wing, environmentalist Greens.

CSU lawmaker Robert Brannekaemper told CNN he was still optimistic the party would retain enough votes to come out ahead, even if it loses support to what he described as a "counter-trend of populism."

"Bavaria is a safe and rich state, with the lowest unemployment in the country. We ought to get 60%," he told CNN. "But there is also a counter-trend in Europe. Italy, France, Holland -- everywhere. Considering this, we hope to get 40%, as a top result."
