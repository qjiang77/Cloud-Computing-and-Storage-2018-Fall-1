'Titans' launches DC battle to turn heroes into subscribers|http://cnn.com/entertainment|http://cnn.com/2018/10/12/entertainment/titans-dc-review/index.html||2018-10-12|Brian Lowry||(CNN) "Titans" is a superhero hybrid -- a live-action series that essentially weds the CW's DC Comics-inspired fare with the gritty, premium-cable approach of Marvel's Netflix dramas. That's not a bad formula, and it yields an entertaining, heavily serialized show; whether it's reason enough to ante up for DC Universe, the new dedicated streaming service, is another matter.

Although "Teen Titans" has become a popular animated staple on Cartoon Network, "Titans" -- which employs the same (mostly) mix of characters -- is squarely aimed at an older crowd, tersely serving notice of those intentions when Robin is asked about Batman and delivers a colorful four-letter reply.

Here, super-sidekick Dick Grayson (Brenton Thwaites) is actually well into his 20s, and a new detective with a decidedly bad attitude. When he finally does leap into action in costume (and like the Netflix shows, there's a lot more tough talk and posturing), he certainly doesn't pull any punches.

The series, however -- like "Flash," "Arrow," et al., from Warner Bros. and producer Greg Berlanti -- unfolds on multiple fronts, introducing other characters with extraordinary powers and plenty of questions about how they got them. That includes Raven (Teagan Croft), a teenager being pursued by shadowy forces; and Starfire/Koriand'r (Anna Diop), a magenta-haired amazon whose destructive gifts are a surprise even to her.

Slowly dribbling out plot, and seemingly in no hurry to bring the team together, "Titans" wants to capture the youthful uncertainty traditionally associated with X-Men as well as the dark, brooding environs of Marvel series like "Daredevil" and "Luke Cage."
