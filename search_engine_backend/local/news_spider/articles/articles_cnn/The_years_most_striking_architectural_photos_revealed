From a seashore chapel in Qinhuangdao, northeast China, to an abandoned power station in Budapest, some of the world&#39;s most eclectic buildings have appeared in images shortlisted in the annual Architectural Photography Awards.

The 20 finalists, named across four main categories (exterior, interior, buildings in use and &quot;sense of place&quot;) will be exhibited at the World Architecture Festival in Amsterdam from Nov. 28-30. Winners will be announced on the last day of the event.

Photographs from almost 50 different countries, including Australia, Canada and India, were entered into this year&#39;s competition.

Two very different images of London attraction, The Hive, were shortlisted in the sense of place category. Omer Kanipak captured children peering through the glass of the multi-sensory installation, while Jeff Eden shot the sculpture&#39;s exterior in the snow.

Elsewhere, a photograph of the &quot;Vortex,&quot; the timber-clad lobby of Bloomberg&#39;s European headquarters, was a finalist in the interior category. And an eerie aerial shot of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau border crossing was shortlisted in the exterior category.

While most images are devoid of people, several photographers used human subjects to illustrate the social impact of architecture. A powerful image by Chinese photographer Zhu Wenqiao shows swimmers wading into waters where the Yangtze and Jialing rivers meet, opposite the construction site of a new building complex by Safdie Architects in the Chinese city of Chongqing.
