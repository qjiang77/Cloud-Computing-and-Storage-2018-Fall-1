Nguyen Ngoc Nhu Quynh, who is known by her online pseudonym, Me Nam -- which translates to &quot;Mother Mushroom&quot; -- touched down in the US late Wednesday, accompanied by her mother and two young children, according to Karen Tang, a US embassy spokeswoman.

A photo posted online by the Committee to Protect Journalists appears to show Nguyen and her two young children on board a flight out of Vietnam.

Nguyen, whose blog covered issues such as land confiscation, freedom of speech and police brutality, was released a year and a half into a 10-year sentence for &quot;conducting anti-State propaganda&quot; on Wednesday morning.

The blogger, famous for her tagline, &quot;Who will speak if you don&#39;t?&quot; was arrested by the Department of Public Security on October 10, 2016, according to the state-run Vietnam News Agency (VNA), which referred to her in reports as an &quot;anti-state instigator.&quot;
