Doctors believe he won&#39;t live until Christmas -- so his town brought Christmas to him

(CNN) &quot;Jingle Bells&quot; played on radios across Ohio. The local mall plastered &quot;Merry Christmas&quot; on its digital signs. And hundreds of people, in 90-degree weather, wore Santa hats as they caroled in front of one little boy&#39;s home. It&#39;s only September, but for a 2-year-old with terminal brain cancer, Christmas came early this year.

Colerain Township, a suburb of Cincinnati, celebrated the holiday this weekend because doctors say the boy, Brody Allen, wouldn&#39;t make it to December.

Despite aggressive and painful chemotherapy, brain scans showed that Brody&#39;s five embryonal tumors were not responding to treatment. &quot;The doctor had tears in his eyes as he was telling us,&quot; said his aunt, Dina Brock. &quot;The poor boy had gone through so much in the hospital, but there wasn&#39;t any good news.&quot;

After Brody spent more than 90 days at Cincinnati Children&#39;s Hospital, much of it in the intensive care unit, the Allen family decided to bring him home. Painful radiation therapy would do little for his prognosis, doctors told the family, and &quot;we wanted to do everything we could to let him live life,&quot; said Brock.

Brody Allen, who has a rare form of brain cancer, celebrated Christmas early because he is not expected to live through December.
