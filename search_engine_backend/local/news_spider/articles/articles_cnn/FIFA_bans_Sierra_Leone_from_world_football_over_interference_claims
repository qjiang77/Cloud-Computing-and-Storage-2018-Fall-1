FIFA bans Sierra Leone from world football over interference claims|http://cnn.com/africa|http://cnn.com/2018/10/05/football/fifa-sierra-leone-football-ban-africa/index.html||2018-10-05|Stephanie Busari,Alex Thomas||Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) FIFA has suspended Sierra Leone from world football over claims of government interference.

The suspension comes after FIFA sent a letter to the country&#39;s Minister of Sports expressing &quot;grave concern&quot; about the removal of the football association president, Isha Johansen and the association&#39;s General Secretary, Christopher Kamara.

In a statement, FIFA said: &quot;The Bureau of the FIFA Council decided today to suspend the Sierra Leone Football Association (SLFA) with immediate effect due to government interference.&quot;

The ban couldn&#39;t have come at a worse time for the country as Sierra Leone is just one week ahead of a crucial African Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifier against Ghana on October 11.

Following the ban, SLFA has lost all membership rights, FIFA said. This means the SLFA&#39;s national and club teams are no longer entitled to take part in international competitions until the suspension is lifted.
