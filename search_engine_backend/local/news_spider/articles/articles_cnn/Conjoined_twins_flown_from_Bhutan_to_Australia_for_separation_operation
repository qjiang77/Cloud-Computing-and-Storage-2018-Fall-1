Conjoined twins flown from Bhutan to Australia for separation operation|http://cnn.com/australia|http://cnn.com/2018/10/02/health/australia-bhutan-conjoined-twins-intl/index.html||2018-10-02|Alex Stambaugh||(CNN) A pair of conjoined twins have been flown from Bhutan to Australia, where doctors hope they will be able to operate on the 14-month-old girls, who have grown up facing each other, unable to move independently.

Joe Crameri, a doctor at Melbourne Royal Children's Hospital, said staff were examining the twins, Dawa and Nima Pelden, who are joined at the stomach, with the hopes they will be able to carry out of a life-changing operation to separate them.

"Once we've got that information, then we'll be able to formulate a more correct plan for how we can separate these twins but at the moment we remain confident that we should achieve that in a single operation and we should be able to achieve a good outcome for both twins," Crameri said.

The twins and their mother arrive at Melbourne airport in Australia, where doctors hope to carry out of a life-changing surgery on them.

A team of six surgeons and dozens of specialist nurses have been assembled for what is likely to be a lengthy operation on the twins, according to CNN affiliate 9 News

"All these twins are unique in the way that they're connected. This set of twins are connected predominantly in the abdomen, maybe slightly in the lower part of the chest," Crameri said.
