Man accused of trying to steal plane at Orlando Melbourne airport will be deported|http://cnn.com/australia|http://cnn.com/2018/10/06/us/orlando-melbourne-airport-attempted-plane-thief-deported/index.html||2018-10-06|Nicole Chavez||(CNN) A student who hopped over a fence and boarded an empty passenger jet at the Orlando Melbourne International Airport is set to be deported to Trinidad and Tobago, the Florida State Attorney&#39;s Office said.

Nishal Sankat, 22, pleaded guilty Monday to burglary to a conveyance after he boarded an American Airlines Airbus A321 two weeks ago and was stopped by maintenance workers, prompting a five-hour security lockdown at the airport.

Sankat was sentenced to time served for the 12 days he spent in custody since his arrest, the attorney&#39;s office said. He was also ordered to pay $909.45 -- the cost of the investigation conducted by the airport&#39;s police.

Local and federal authorities found that Sankat &quot;acted alone and was suffering from depression and mental health issues&quot; when he boarded the plane, the Florida State Attorney&#39;s Office said in a statement.

He was unarmed and carried no explosives at the time of the incident, authorities said.
