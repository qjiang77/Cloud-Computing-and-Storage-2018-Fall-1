(CNN) Tuesday night, &quot;The Conners&quot; opened with the (spoiler alert) death of Roseanne Conner. The matriarch of the family overdosed on opioids.

In reality, Roseanne Barr overdosed on entitled bigotry, supported by a culture at war, where the President of the United States is celebrated for being an open racist or gentrifiers feel empowered to call the police as a manifest destiny weapon of choice. Scroll through your social media feed, there are passionate debates about right and wrong, defenders for any and every deplorable act.

Throughout the episode, Roseanne&#39;s sister Jackie, played by Laurie Metcalf, is manically cleaning, appearing to wipe away whatever Roseanne left behind. This is not a subtle metaphor. Clearly, ABC wants to maintain the cash cow of Barr&#39;s history-making sitcom &quot;Roseanne&quot; without the baggage carried by the show&#39;s star.

The truth is, nothing will remove the stain of Roseanne. Not changing the title, not funny one-liners and certainly not the passage of five months since she was fired. Barr&#39;s legacy is in every frame of &quot;The Conners.&quot; As the episode continued, it was clear that there was no need to bring this family back for a second time around. Moreover, it&#39;s past time and crucial to let all reboots go in our recycled culture.
