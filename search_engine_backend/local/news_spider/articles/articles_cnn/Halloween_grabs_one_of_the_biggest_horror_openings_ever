'Halloween' grabs one of the biggest horror openings ever|http://cnn.com/business|http://cnn.com/2018/10/21/business/halloween-box-office/index.html||2018-10-21|Frank Pallotta,Cnn Business||New York (CNN Business) It&#39;s hard to say it any other way: Michael Myers made a killing at the box office this weekend.

Universal&#39;s &quot; Halloween ,&quot; the 11th film in the horror franchise, beat expectations and earned an estimated $77.5 million in North America this weekend. That&#39;s the best opening ever for the 40-year-old slasher series.

It also marks second biggest debut for a horror film behind last year&#39;s &quot;It,&quot; which had a $123 million opening

The sequel, which stars Jamie Lee Curtis, adds to a blockbuster October . Earlier this month &quot;Venom&quot; notched a record setting $80 million , the best October debut on the books.

&quot;Halloween&quot; capitalized on its own brand recognition and the recent popularity of the horror genre to bring in such a big weekend. Films such as &quot;Get Out,&quot; &quot;A Quiet Place&quot; and &quot;It&quot; have all surprised Hollywood in recent years with big box office totals.

The slasher film, which is a direct sequel to the 1978 classic, was also a hit with critics as well as audiences. It earned an 80% score on review site Rotten Tomatoes.

The surprising returns for &quot;Halloween&quot; mark another win for Hollywood, which is up 10.6% from the same point last year, according to comScore. This weekend&#39;s box office itself was up a whopping 71.7% from the same weekend in 2017.

The rest of the year also looks promising for the film industry. Potential blockbusters such as Warner Bros.&#39; &quot;Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald,&quot; Paramount&#39;s &quot;Bumblebee&quot; and Disney&#39;s &quot;Mary Poppins Returns&quot; are still on the schedule for the rest of the year.
