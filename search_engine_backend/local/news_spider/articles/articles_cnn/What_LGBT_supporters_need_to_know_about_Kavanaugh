(CNN) Brett Kavanaugh has replaced Anthony Kennedy on the US Supreme Court. For all the scrutiny of Justice Kavanaugh&#39;s personal life, his hearings told us little about where he will land on gay rights. Americans across the political spectrum have reason for concern -- especially pro-LGBT conservatives like ourselves who relied on Justice Kennedy as a champion of limited government. With the polarizing Kavanaugh confirmation now behind us, gay rights advocates need to prepare for the political reality of a rightward shift in the Supreme Court, because much more than marriage is at stake.

With Justice Kennedy&#39;s retirement, America should be grateful to a man who consistently stood up for individual freedom, even when unpopular. His libertarian streak greatly advanced the lives of LGBT Americans, and his successor should honor this legacy. The next chapter of LGBT progress does not lie solely with the Supreme Court -- and that was true before Justice Kennedy announced his retirement. Instead, the next chapter of LGBT progress lies in red states and in Congress, where comprehensive laws are needed to protect LGBT Americans from discrimination. Such legislation and other pressing LGBT issues will continue to be reviewed by the Supreme Court, and we will need Justice Kavanaugh&#39;s support.

To begin, it is crucial for Justice Kavanaugh to affirm both the 2013 Windsor and 2015 Obergefell decisions, which established the legality of same-sex marriage, recognizing not only the precedential weight of those decisions but also their correctness. He came very close in answering Senator Cory Booker&#39;s questions about Obergefell and the freedom to marry when he said , &quot;The law of the land protects that right as dictated by the Supreme Court and the precedent of the Supreme Court.&quot; Still, he hesitated to give this response and first tried to offer several reasons why he couldn&#39;t answer the question.

Justice Kavanaugh&#39;s record and position on LGBT issues is otherwise unclear . He avoided ruling on the issue during his time on the circuit court bench. Very soon, Justice Kavanaugh may be faced with cases beyond just the question of marriage, as LGBT Americans still face constant discrimination and violence.

One somber reminder of this fact is the anniversary of Matthew Shepard&#39;s death: in 1998, his brutal murder in Wyoming shook the nation. It was recently announced that his remains will be interred later this month at Washington National Cathedral. But today, 20 years later, only 18 states have implemented hate crime laws that address sexual orientation and gender identity, and another 12 have laws for hate crimes based on sexual orientation.
