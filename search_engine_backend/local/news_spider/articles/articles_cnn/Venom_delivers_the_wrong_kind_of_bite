'Venom' delivers the wrong kind of bite|http://cnn.com/entertainment|http://cnn.com/2018/10/03/entertainment/venom-review/index.html||2018-10-03|Brian Lowry||(CNN) "Venom" bites, all right, but not with any consistency, and seldom in the manner intended.

More monster movie than a superhero one, Sony's attempt to expand its Spider-Man franchise with this solo vehicle for one of his more colorful villains makes a mess of the tone, staggering from horror-tinged nastiness to split-personality comedy. The result is a not-so-Marvel-ous misfire that leaves little to latch onto except perhaps for the most invested comics fans.

The whole exercise, frankly, invited skepticism from the get-go, given the idea of building around a character featured in the bottom-rung-of-the-web sequel "Spider-Man 3." Still, casting Tom Hardy prompted some excitement and enthusiasm, even if his face was likely to be obscured a lot -- again -- as it was in "The Dark Knight Rises" and "Dunkirk."

Hardy's toothy performance, however, employs a distracting cadence, even before you get to the movie's other abundant flaws. And the central idea -- a journalist forced to share his body with an alien symbiote, whose presence grants him extraordinary powers -- actually brings to mind less the fringes of the Marvel universe than the 1984 comedy "All of Me," in which Steve Martin and Lily Tomlin found themselves in a similar squabbling predicament.

Hardy's Eddie Brock lands in this situation thanks to the machinations of mad billionaire scientist Carlton Drake ("The Night Of's" Riz Ahmed), who, shades of Elon Musk, has been using his fortune to explore space. Drake's master plan is to bring back these dangerous alien life forms, using human guinea pigs trying to find appropriate hosts.
