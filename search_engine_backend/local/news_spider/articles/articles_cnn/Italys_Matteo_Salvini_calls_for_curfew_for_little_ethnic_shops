Italy's Matteo Salvini calls for curfew for 'little ethnic shops'|http://cnn.com/world|http://cnn.com/2018/10/12/europe/italy-salvini-shop-curfew-intl/index.html||2018-10-12|Matthew Robinson,Gianluca Mezzofiore||(CNN) Italy's hard-line interior minister and deputy prime minister sparked outrage on Thursday after announcing a proposed amendment to his security decree that would force "little ethnic shops" to close by 9 p.m.

Matteo Salvini, leader of Italy's far-right League party, announced the proposal during a Facebook Live on Thursday, arguing that foreign-owned grocery shops have become "meeting places for drunkards, pushers, hell-raisers."

"There are people who drink beer and whiskey until 3am, and (relieve themselves) on the doors and gates of (neighboring) houses," Salvini said.

The interior minister defended his statements, sayinig his proposed amendment was not an attack on foreign stores.

Italys Interior Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini speaks on the TV set of Italian talk show "Porta a Porta" on Rai 1 on June 20.

"It is not an initiative against foreign shops, but it is to limit the abuses and irregularities of certain shops -- almost all of which are managed by foreign citizens -- which have become havens for people who raise hell," Salvini said.
