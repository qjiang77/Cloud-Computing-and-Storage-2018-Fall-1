'Halloween' sequel is up to its old tricks|http://cnn.com/entertainment|http://cnn.com/2018/10/18/entertainment/halloween-review/index.html||2018-10-18|Brian Lowry||(CNN) The idea of doing a sequel to the original &quot;Halloween&quot; 40 years later -- ignoring all the screen mayhem in between -- is pretty inspired. Alas, that largely exhausts any freshness in a movie that, after the first sight of Jamie Lee Curtis and initial strains of that eerie musical score, draws heavily on the old bag of tricks, built around slicing and dicing unsuspecting teenagers.

In this new version from director David Gordon Green (who also wrote the script with frequent collaborators Danny McBride and Jeff Fradley), all the intervening movies have been set aside. So with apologies to all those other sequels (RIP), in this timeline the murderous Michael Myers has spent the last four decades in what&#39;s clearly a not-very-effective mental-rehabilitation facility.

Meanwhile, Curtis&#39; Laurie Strode has been living in her own kind of prison, erecting what amounts to a fortress for the inevitable day that Michael comes knocking -- exhibiting &quot;paranoia&quot; that has driven away her daughter Karen (Judy Greer) and kept her at arm&#39;s length from her teenage granddaughter, Allyson (newcomer Andi Matichak).

Of course, Michael can&#39;t stay locked up, or people would have no reason to pony up their cash. So a series of contortions free him, and -- thanks to some very stupid investigative journalists -- even reunite him with that horrible mask.

After that, though, Halloween devolves into a fairly by-the-numbers slasher movie -- those numbers including a whole lot of gruesome deaths, mostly involving Allyson&#39;s classmates. If the lessons of the &#39;70s and &#39;80s movies in this genre taught us anything -- Michael, Freddy, Jason -- it&#39;s don&#39;t get attached to anyone who isn&#39;t old enough to drink legally.
