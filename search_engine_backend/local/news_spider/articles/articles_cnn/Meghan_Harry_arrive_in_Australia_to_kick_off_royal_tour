Meghan, Harry arrive in Australia to kick off royal tour|http://cnn.com/australia|http://cnn.com/2018/10/15/australia/harry-meghan-australia-invictus-games-intl/index.html||2018-10-15|Joshua Berlinger||(CNN) Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, have touched down in Sydney for an official two week tour.

During the visit, which is their second official trip since their marriage in May, they&#39;ll visit Australia, New Zealand, Tonga and Fiji.

The tour coincides with the fourth Invictus Games, an international sporting competition for wounded veterans and members of the military created by Prince Harry in 2014.

The games will be held in Sydney this year and will be opened by Harry raising a flag on Sydney Harbor Bridge after climbing the structure.

Most of their time will be spent in Australia, where they&#39;ll meet with locals and focus on youth leadership projects -- Harry was recently named Commonwealth Youth Ambassador -- but also take in the sights.
