The move, intended to tackle the tragedy of 4,500 people taking their own lives in England each year, comes on World Mental Health Day.

Jackie Doyle-Price, a Conservative MP and current health minister, has been appointed to lead the government's efforts to confront the issue, which is the leading cause of death in men aged under 45.
