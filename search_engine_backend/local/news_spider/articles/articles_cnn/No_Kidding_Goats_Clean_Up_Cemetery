PLYMOUTH, Pa. -- A cemetery in Luzerne County has some unique volunteers helping clean up.

A call for volunteers at Shawnee Cemetery in Plymouth got the attention of some unsuspected helpers.

&quot;I drove by one day and saw the signs out here and I sent them a message,&quot; said Brian Vick, or as he calls himself &quot;the goat master.&quot;

The man from Wapwallopen owns 16 goats and rents them out to help clear land. He&#39;s donated the services of his goats to help clear an overgrown section of the cemetery.

&quot;Clean out brush, woody areas, woods, fields anything that is overgrown, the goats will eat, poison ivy, thistles, thicker bushes. It&#39;s amazing what goats will eat.&quot;

Vick says this is an easier and greener way to clear an overgrown area.

&quot;In some areas, it&#39;s also more advantageous. The goats are able to get into places that are harder for humans â€“ hillsides, steep areas, things that are rough terrain or equipment has a hard time. Humans don&#39;t really want to walk on a steep hill with a weed whacker and other pieces of equipment.&quot;

Shawnee Cemetery covers more than 13 acres and has around 15,000 burials across it.

With its location on the side of a hill, the cemetery&#39;s president says it could cost thousands of dollars to hire someone to tend to the cemetery and that it is hard to find volunteers.

&quot;Today, that has died off. Now, if people visit their family&#39;s graves twice a year, that&#39;s great. I could be here for a week and maybe only see two people come,&quot; said Shawnee Cemetery president Tom Jesso.

The goats will be at the cemetery for another four to five days.
