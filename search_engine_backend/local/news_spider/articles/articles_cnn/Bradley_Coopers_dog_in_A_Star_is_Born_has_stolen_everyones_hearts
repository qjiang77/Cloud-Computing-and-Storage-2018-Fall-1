Bradley Cooper's dog in 'A Star is Born' has stolen everyone's hearts|http://cnn.com/entertainment|http://cnn.com/2018/10/08/entertainment/a-star-is-born-dog/index.html||2018-10-08|Sandra Gonzalez||(CNN) Warning: This article contains major spoilers from "A Star Is Born."

A star is, indeed, born in Bradley Cooper's much-praised directorial debut: He has four legs, the kind of soft-looking fur that demands to be cuddled, and his name (both in the film and real life) is Charlie.

The pooch at the center of dog-lover's collective post-"A Star Is Born" meltdown is also Cooper's real-life canine pal, a rescue dog who he cast as the companion for himself and on-screen love Ally (Lady Gaga).

In the film, Cooper has said during press rounds , Ally and his character, Jackson Maine, don't have children. But Charlie is "part of their story," in a way a kid would be.
