"Selena is receiving treatment and has the full support of her friends and family," the source said. "She was recently hospitalized after complications from her kidney transplant, and she's committed to focusing on her health."

Gomez, who has more than 144 million followers on Instagram, announced last month that she would be taking a break from social media.

"As much as I am grateful for the voice that social media gives each of us, I am equally grateful to be able to step back and live my life present to the moment I have been given," Gomez wrote in the caption of a picture announcing the break. "Kindness and encouragement only for a bit! Just remember- negative comments can hurt anybody's feelings."

Gomez has been open in the past about her health issues.
