Mexican couple arrested with body parts in stroller may have killed 20|http://cnn.com/americas|http://cnn.com/2018/10/09/americas/mexican-murders-intl/index.html||2018-10-09|Mitch Mccluskey,Alejandra Morales,Lianne Kolirin||(CNN) A couple arrested in Mexico while pushing a baby stroller filled with human body parts may have killed up to 20 women, according to the chief investigator on the case.

The man and woman were detained Thursday in the Mexico City suburb of Ecatepec on suspicion of murdering 10 female victims. However, the male suspect has since claimed that they are responsible for twice as many deaths.

Police arrested the pair, identified only as &quot;Juan Carlos N.&quot; and his wife &quot;Patricia &quot;N.,&quot; during an investigation into the disappearance of three women and a two-month-old baby. The man gave detailed accounts of the original 10 deaths. He also told police that he and his wife had killed a further 10 people, according to State of Mexico Prosecutor Alejandro Gomez and reported by AFP.

Police found eight plastic buckets full of dismembered body parts and cement in the couple&#39;s house, Gomez revealed in a Facebook post on Sunday. More remains were found in a refrigerator, wrapped in plastic bags. Tests are now being carried out on the grisly evidence.

The couple, who live with their three children, were arrested while pushing the baby carriage through Ecatepec. The police had expected to find the missing baby inside, but instead found human remains.
