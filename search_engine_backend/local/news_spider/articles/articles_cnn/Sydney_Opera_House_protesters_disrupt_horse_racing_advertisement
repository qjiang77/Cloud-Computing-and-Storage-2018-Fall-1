Plans to splash an advertisement for the Everest Cup horse race on the side of the UNESCO World Heritage site fiercely divided Australia&#39;s largest city in the past week.

Hundreds of protestors shouting &quot;our house&quot; gathered outside the Opera House late on Tuesday, carrying banners and torches ahead of the light show which began shortly before 8 p.m. (5 a.m. ET).

Loud boos broke out when the side of the building lit up with the advertisement for the upcoming race and bright white lights from the protestors&#39; flashlights partially disrupted the light show.
