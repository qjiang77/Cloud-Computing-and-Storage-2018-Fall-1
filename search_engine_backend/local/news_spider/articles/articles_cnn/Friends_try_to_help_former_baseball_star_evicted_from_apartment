MEMPHIS, Tenn. — Lonnie Harris still remembers his baseball days and some of those he played with — &quot;Willie Mays, Hank Aaron, Jackie Robinson,&quot; he says.

He still signs his Red Sox baseball cards even though he&#39;s a few months shy of 89 years old.

Back then, in the 1950&#39;s, he was known as &quot;Showboat&quot; when he played for the Negro Baseball League for the Memphis Red Sox.

But as of Thursday afternoon, this self-proclaimed baseball legend, veteran and former Humes Junior High teacher was looking for a place to live.

Harris was recently evicted from Glendale Park Apartments near Park and Getwell, where he says he&#39;s lived for eight years.

He said he gave a large amount of money to someone else living in the complex and the money somehow disappeared. That forced him to not have money to pay his rent.

&quot;I&#39;m totally embarrassed,&quot; he said.

Despite what he&#39;s going through, he&#39;s still full of laughter, and ready to talk about his baseball days.

Harris played center field and was known for his flashy way of catching the ball.

&quot;I really put on a show for the fans,&quot; he said.

And before he played in Memphis, he went to the Birmingham Black Barons, where he won a batting title.

&quot;I played baseball all the time in the Army,&quot; he said.

Harris says those who know him at the complex are doing what they can to help him now.

They&#39;re making sure the baseball legend is not left out in the cold.

Thursday, some of Harris&#39; belongings were out on the curb, and he was working to find a permanent place to stay.

The manager of the complex said everything in the eviction was done properly through the court system.
