NFL owner pulls bid for Wembley Stadium|http://cnn.com/europe|http://cnn.com/2018/10/17/uk/wembley-stadium-khan-bid-intl/index.html||2018-10-17|Rob Picheta||London (CNN) The proposed Â£600 million ($788 million) purchase of London&#39;s Wembley Stadium has fallen through after American businessman Shahid Khan withdrew his bid.

Khan, who owns the NFL franchise Jacksonville Jaguars and English Premier League club Fulham, made the decision after his bid received criticism from some figures within English soccer.

&quot;The intent of my efforts was, and is, to do right by everyone in a manner that strengthens the English game and brings people together, not divides them,&quot; Khan said in a statement on Wednesday. He had made his offer to England&#39;s Football Association (FA) governing body public in April.

&quot;I cannot rule out revisiting the opportunity at another time when perhaps the Football Association family is unified in its views on the opportunity,&quot; Khan added.

The FA had pledged to invest proceeds from the sale into the grassroots of English soccer, and Khan&#39;s bid had received support from FA Chief Executive Martin Glenn.
