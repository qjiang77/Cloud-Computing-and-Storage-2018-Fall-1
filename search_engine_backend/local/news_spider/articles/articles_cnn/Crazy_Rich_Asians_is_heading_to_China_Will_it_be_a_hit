'Crazy Rich Asians' is heading to China. Will it be a hit?|http://cnn.com/entertainment|http://cnn.com/2018/10/16/media/crazy-rich-asians-china/index.html||2018-10-16|Sherisse Pham,Cnn Business||China&#39;s movie regulator typically allows only 34 foreign films to be shown in theaters each year. Scoring one of those coveted slots can significantly boost a movie&#39;s global box office returns. Several big budget Hollywood films like &quot;Ready Player One&quot; and &quot;Black Panther&quot; had bigger debuts in China than in North America.

&quot;Crazy Rich Asians&quot; has a different title for China that roughly translates as &quot;Tales of Gold Digging.&quot; That&#39;s at odds with the movie&#39;s storyline in which the main character is initially clueless about her Singaporean boyfriend&#39;s incredible family wealth. When it came to Hong Kong in late August, the title was translated to &quot;My Super Rich Boyfriend.&quot;

In the United States, the movie was lauded for featuring an all-Asian cast at a time when Hollywood has come under fire for its lack of diversity . In China, where the majority of films feature all-Asian casts, that&#39;s much less remarkable.

Warner Bros. didn&#39;t respond to a request for comment on whether any changes had been made to the film at the request of the Chinese regulator.

The makers of &quot;Crazy Rich Asians&quot; had been hoping for a run in the world&#39;s second largest movie market.

&quot;We&#39;re all praying to the China gods right now,&quot; producer John Penotti said in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter in August. &quot;From my colleagues in Beijing, it looks like we&#39;re in strong consideration.&quot;

&quot;Crazy Rich Asians&quot; was a late summer hit in the United States and has since released in dozens of countries, from Australia to Venezuela. It has made $228 million worldwide so far.
