Russian defeated Conor McGregor Sunday

Pair face temporary suspension

(CNN) Russian fighter Khabib Nurmagomedov has threatened to quit UFC in the wake of his victory over Conor McGregor in Las Vegas at the weekend.

Nurmagomedov's countryman Zubaira Tukhugov -- a rostered featherweight fighter -- has been pulled from a fight against Artem Lobov following the brawl that broke out after Saturday's fight. In the chaos that ensued Tukhugov exchanged blows with McGregor after climbing into the ring.

"You canceled Zubaira's fight and you want to dismiss him just because he hit Conor," Nurmagomedov said in a lengthy Instagram post addressed to UFC.

"But don't forget that it was Conor who had hit my another Brother FIRST [sic], just check the video.

"If you decide to fire him, you should know that you'll lose me too. We never give up on our brothers in Russia and I will go to the end for my Brother."
