9 midterms races with Electoral College implications|http://cnn.com/election|http://cnn.com/2018/10/20/politics/redistricting-races-to-watch-2018-electoral-college/index.html||2018-10-20|Lauren Dezenski||Washington (CNN) Redistricting! It&#39;s not just for wonks.

Here&#39;s why it really matters -- and why the 2018 election will have a major impact on the election cycles to come:

Voters this fall will install 30 governors and more than 800 legislators that will be responsible for redrawing voting districts in three years -- which will have a major impact in each and every state in the country, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures

And for a select handful of states (flashing in that nifty graphic above as projected by the NSCL), their projected major population gain (or loss) means that they are gaining (or losing) representation in Congress -- and Electoral College votes.

The redistricting process happens every decade. And the people involved with that process, in many cases, local legislators (some states use appointed commissions) will be the ones involved in drawing the lines -- and many governors will have the power of veto to nix or approve those redrawn districts.
