Richard Branson temporarily suspends ties with Saudi government|http://cnn.com/world|http://cnn.com/2018/10/11/business/branson-saudi-khashoggi/index.html||2018-10-11|Victoria Cavaliere,Cnn Business||New York (CNN Business) Richard Branson said Thursday he's pulling back from two tourism projects in Saudi Arabia and has suspended discussions with the Saudi government about a $1 billion investment in Virgin's space companies.

The British billionaire and founder of the Virgin business empire said in a statement that he was stepping away amid mounting questions about the kingdom's role in the disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi -- who was last seen entering the Saudi consulate general in Istanbul on October 2.

"What has reportedly happened in Turkey around the disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, if proved true, would clearly change the ability of any of us in the West to do business with the Saudi Government," Branson said in the statement.

Branson said he has asked Saudi authorities "to clarify their position in relation to Mr Khashoggi."

"While those investigations are ongoing and Mr Khashoggi's presence is not known, I will suspend my directorships of the two tourism projects. Virgin will also suspend its discussions with the Public Investment Fund over the proposed investment in our space companies Virgin Galactic and Virgin Orbit," he said.
