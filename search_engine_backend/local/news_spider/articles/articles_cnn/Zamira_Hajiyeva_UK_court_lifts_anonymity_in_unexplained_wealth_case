Zamira Hajiyeva: UK court lifts anonymity in unexplained wealth case|http://cnn.com/europe|http://cnn.com/2018/10/10/uk/uk-wealth-order-hajiyeva-intl/index.html||2018-10-10|Laura Smith-Spark||London (CNN) A woman whose husband is a jailed state banker in Azerbaijan has lost a court fight to avoid being named as she seeks to explain how she paid for two properties worth £22 million ($29 million) in total, Britain's Press Association reported Wednesday.

Zamira Hajiyeva, who is the subject of the first two unexplained wealth orders obtained by the UK National Crime Agency (NCA), also spent more than £16 million over a decade at luxury department store Harrods, a High Court judgment said, according to PA.

The High Court order dismissing her attempt to throw out the NCA case and maintain her anonymity was made last week, when Hajiyeva was named only as "Mrs A," but her lawyers were given a week to appeal. The anonymity order was lifted Wednesday after a judge ruled that "no good case" had been made for extending it, PA said.

If Hajiyeva cannot explain how she afforded the assets in question, she could lose them. One property, worth around £11.5 million, is in the rich London neighborhood of Knightsbridge, where Harrods is located.

Hajiyeva's husband, Jahangir Hajiyev, was the chairman of the state-controlled International Bank of Azerbaijan from 2001 until his resignation in 2015. He was later sentenced to 15 years on fraud and embezzlement charges, PA reported.

An address listed as belonging to Zamira Hajiyeva, the wife of the former chairman of Azerbaijan's largest bank, is pictured in London on Wednesday.
