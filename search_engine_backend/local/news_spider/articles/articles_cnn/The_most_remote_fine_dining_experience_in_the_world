The most remote fine dining experience in the world?|http://cnn.com/asia|http://cnn.com/style/article/koks-restaurant-faroe-islands/index.html||2018-09-19|Cnn Staff||Written by CNN Staff

In Pursuit of Rare is a new series telling the stories of the master makers who deal in the most precious things on earth.

This is a fine dining experience that requires dedication. Koks, the Faroe Islands&#39; first Michelin-starred restaurant, is well off the beaten path, and sits in a remote location of the tiny North Atlantic archipelago, midway between Iceland and Norway.

&quot;Restaurant Koks is located in a valley, far from the main road. it&#39;s very harsh and wild nature around us,&quot; said chef Poul Andrias Ziska.

The local climate is also famously windy, and parts of the restaurant have been literally blown into the sea before.

&quot;That&#39;s the whole experience. I mean you start down by the lake together with the other guests and then you&#39;re being driven up here away from everything. You don&#39;t see any lights you don&#39;t see any cars. You don&#39;t see the people you just here in the little house. And then I think that really sets the mood. You have to trust us even more than just the food,&quot; he said.

Because the Faroe Island are 99% ocean, Ziska says, the majority of the menu comes from the sea, and almost all the rest is made from locale ingredients. Some are particularly interesting, like the mahogany clam.

&quot;It is one of the oldest creatures you can find in the sea. You can get over 500 years old. So it&#39;s only us and the scientists that are using them, that I know at least.&quot;

Next to the restaurant, a smaller house is used to ferment the meat, which is simply hanged without adding anything and starts to naturally break down.

The restaurant offers a 17-course tasting menu which includes sea urchin, wild sorrel and wind-dried mutton.

&quot;I feel that we can be a little bit more daring than if we only had three dishes. So for some guests we really challenged them. We have dishes that almost are alive,&quot; said Ziska.
