Australian government votes for motion saying 'it's okay to be white'|http://cnn.com/australia|http://cnn.com/2018/10/15/australia/pauline-hanson-white-australia-intl/index.html||2018-10-15|Ben Westcott||(CNN) A motion decrying the &quot;deplorable rise of anti-white racism&quot; was only narrowly voted down in the Australian Senate Monday, despite support from the ruling Liberal-National coalition and several senior ministers.

The motion, put forward by right-wing, anti-immigrant Senator Pauline Hanson, failed to pass the Senate 28 votes to 31, after opposition members from the Labor Party and the Greens voted against it. The government does not have a majority in the upper house.

In its entirety, the bill called for the Australian Senate to acknowledge &quot;the deplorable rise of anti-white racism and attacks on Western civilization,&quot; adding that &quot;it is okay to be white.&quot;

&quot;People have a right to be proud of their cultural background, whether they are black, white or brindle. If we cannot agree on this, I think it&#39;s safe to say anti-white racism is well and truly rife in our society,&quot; Hanson said on Monday.

Australian Senator Pauline Hanson wears a burqa in Parliament as she calls for a burqa ban in August.
