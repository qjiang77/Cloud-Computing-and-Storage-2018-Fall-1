Sears' bankruptcy appears imminent|http://cnn.com/business|http://cnn.com/2018/10/12/business/sears-bankruptcy/index.html||2018-10-12|Nathaniel Meyersohn,Chris Isidore,Cnn Business||New York (CNN Business) Sears has to come up with $134 million very quickly.

Sears Holdings ( SHLD ), the parent company of Sears and Kmart, faces a Monday deadline to pay that much in debt.

The most recent filing from Sears showed it had only $193 million in cash on hand as of August 4, the end of its last fiscal quarter. The company also has $269 million available to it from lenders, according to figures it released on September 13.

Having so little cash available would make it very difficult for Sears to pay back $134 million in debt due on Monday. Plus, Sears also has to pay its current vendors and employees and stock up inventory before the holidays.
