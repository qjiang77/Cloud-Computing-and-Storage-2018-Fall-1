'Modern Family's' Ariel Winter says death not who fans think|http://cnn.com/entertainment|http://cnn.com/2018/10/16/entertainment/ariel-winter-modern-family/index.html||2018-10-16|Lisa Respers France||&quot;It&#39;s a character that we&#39;ll all be sad to see go, but it&#39;s probably not an older character that you think is going to go,&quot; Winter told &quot;Entertainment Tonight.&quot;

Viewers of have been in a tizzy since series co-creator Christopher Lloyd revealed that a main character will die in the new season.

&quot;We do deal with a death, which is certainly a topic that families have to deal with, and on television, it&#39;s not easy to do because that&#39;s a heavy subject,&quot; Lloyd told Entertainment Weekly last month. &quot;But at the same time, it would seem unusual for a family not to go through it.&quot;

Winter, who plays teen Alex Dunphy on the sitcom, said, &quot;We haven&#39;t ever really had a death on the show.&quot;

&quot;It definitely impacts the family, as I think it impacts any family,&quot; she said. &quot;Some people have never dealt with death, or if it&#39;s a person close to them, they&#39;re having to deal with them because it&#39;s a tragedy. You follow people&#39;s stories on how they do that, and I think some people obviously take it better than others.&quot;
