Video shows Florida officer hitting 14-year-old twice during arrest|http://cnn.com/us|http://cnn.com/2018/10/20/us/florida-officer-hits-teenage-girl/index.html||2018-10-20|Amir Vera||(CNN) A viral video of a police officer hitting a 14-year-old girl during an arrest has caused outrage in a Florida community.

The video -- posted to Instagram on Friday -- shows a girl being held down by two officers, one man and one woman. The male officer hits the girl in the side twice as he holds her shorts.

&quot;Why you hitting her?&quot; someone in the video yells. &quot;She can&#39;t do that, her hands underneath her, the f*** you hitting her for?&quot;

The police department in Coral Springs, about 30 miles northwest of Fort Lauderdale, said in a statement on Facebook on Friday that the video does not show the entire incident that led to the arrest.

Police said the incident took place Thursday when officers were called to Coral Square Mall about unruly teens who had been harassing people and causing a disturbance. When officers met with mall security, a mother told officers one of the teens shoved her 5-year-old child to the ground. Mall security also told officers one of the teens hit another teen. Officers issued a trespassing warning to the unruly teens and barred them from the mall.
