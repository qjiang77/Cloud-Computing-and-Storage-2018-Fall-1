'Making a Murderer' picks up trail under glare of the spotlight|http://cnn.com/entertainment|http://cnn.com/2018/10/18/entertainment/making-a-murderer-part-2-review/index.html||2018-10-18|Brian Lowry||(CNN) The frenzy stirred by &quot;Making a Murderer&quot; adds an extra dimension to its 10-episode follow-up, to the extent the original docu-series and the fallout from it becomes a significant part of the story.
