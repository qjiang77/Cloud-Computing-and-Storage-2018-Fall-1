Many Canadians celebrated Wednesday as marijuana was sold legally in their country for the first time.

Adults are now allowed to carry and share up to 30 grams of legal marijuana in public, according to a bill that passed the Senate in June. They will also be allowed to cultivate up to four plants in their households and make products for personal use.

Canada is the second country in the world — and the first G7 nation — to implement legislation permitting a nationwide marijuana market.

The Cannabis Act stems from a campaign pledge of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to keep marijuana away from underage users and curb marijuana-related crime.
