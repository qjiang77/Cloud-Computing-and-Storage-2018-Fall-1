Numbers that defined 2015-16 Cal basketball season|http://www.sfgate.com/collegesports|http://blog.sfgate.com/cal/2016/03/21/numbers-that-defined-2015-16-cal-basketball-season/||2016-03-21|Connor Letourneau||The Chronicle is reviewing Cal basketball’s 2015-16 season in a multi-part series. The first installment: A look at the numbers that defined the Bears (23-11, 12-6 Pac-12), who were upset Friday by Hawaii in the first round of the NCAA Tournament:

20.8: Over his final five games of the season, forward Jaylen Brown shot 20.8 percent from the field (10-for-48). His offensive woes were a key reason behind Cal’s early exit from the NCAA Tournament. With Tyrone Wallace (hand injury) and Jabari Bird (back spasms) out, Brown needed to shoulder a bigger scoring load. He went 1-for-6 from the field against the Rainbow Warriors with seven turnovers.

10,183: Cal ranked third in the Pac-12 with an average home attendance of 10,183, up 25.7 percent from last season.

54.5: Over his final 11 games of the season, Bird shot 54.5 percent from three-point range. On a number of occasions, Bird made clutch threes this season. But perhaps no shot was more memorable than the game-winning three he hit with 15 seconds left against St. Mary’s.

19: Cal’s 18-0 home record this season extended its winning streak in Berkeley to 19 games. That is the second longest such run in school history and the eighth-longest current streak in the country.

37: The Bears’ No. 4 seed in the NCAA Tournament marked their best seed in the 37 years that seeds have been handed out. In 1994 and 1997, they were a No. 5 seed.

1: Cal finished one win shy of matching its highest total since the 1960 NCAA runner-up squad went 28-2. The Bears won 24 games in the 2009-10 and 2011-12 seasons.

61.5: Ivan Rabb finished the season 61.5 percent from the field. He is the first Cal player to shoot better than 60 percent for a full season since Solomon Hughes in 2000-01 (62.9 percent).

41.6: A year after shooting 44.3 percent from beyond the arc, guard Jordan Mathews converted 41.6 percent of his threes. The junior netted a season-best six threes against Arizona in Berkeley and had five against Davidson and Colorado. His 201 career threes are fourth on the Bears’ all-time list.

27.1: Rabb and Brown combined to average 27.1 points per game, making them the highest scoring freshman duo in school history. Leon Powe and Marquise Kately are second at 25.6 points per game in 2003-04.

3: Wallace leaves Berkeley among Cal’s career top 10 in three major categories: scoring, assists and steals. Specifically, he checks in at No. 8 with 1,613 points, No. 6 with 437 assists and No. 7 with 139 steals. Wallace is even No. 13 with 676 rebounds.

3: Cal led the Pac-12 in three major defensive categories: field goal percentage defense (39.6 percent), scoring defense (67.3 ppg) and 2-point field goal percentage defense (41.5 percent).

160: Cal finished the season with 160 blocks, just one shy of the school record set in 2012-13. Rabb had 42, while Kingsley Okoroh had 33.

4: It can be difficult to measure the impact of an assistant coach. But Yann Hufnagel, fired Monday amid sexual harassment allegations, was best known as a relentless recruiter. He was involved in bringing at least four players to Berkeley: Brown, Rabb, Brandon Chauca and Roman Davis.

3: In its latest mock-up of the 2016 NBA Draft, NBADraft.net has three Cal players going in the first round: Brown (No. 3), Rabb (No. 9) and Wallace (No. 28). The Bears are the only team with three players projected to go in the first round by that site.

54: If Rabb and Brown declare for the NBA draft, Cal will move forward without players who accounted for at least 54 percent of its points this past season. Guards Tyrone Wallace, Brenden Glapion and Nick Kerr are out of eligibility.

1: With news Sunday that three-star signee Tyson Jolly was requesting his release from Cal, the Bears were left with just one 2016 pledge: unrated JUCO point guard Dontae Coleman.
