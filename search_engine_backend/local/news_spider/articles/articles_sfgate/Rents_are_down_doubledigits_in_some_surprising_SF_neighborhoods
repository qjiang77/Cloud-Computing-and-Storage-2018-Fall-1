Is the long run up of San Francisco rental prices finally coming to an end?

In certain neighborhoods at least, the signs seem to be pointing to a resounding yes, according to a new report from Zumper. The apartment listing site says that the median asking prices for one-bedrooms in Cole Valley are down 14 percent to $2,950, while the Inner Richmond is down 11 percent to $2,550 and Mission Dolores is down 9 percent to $3,350 since the same time last year.

“Last year, in the Inner Richmond and Cole Valley, rents were spiking due to a lot of demand present, since these areas are safe/low on crime and tend to be less expensive than living in the surrounding neighborhoods like Hayes Valley or NOPA,” explained Zumper’s Crystal Chen. “While the demand will always be there for these neighborhoods, the price has come down from last year since less people are looking to move right now and it seems a ceiling has been hit.”

But there’s no ceiling in sight in other San Francisco neighborhoods, like Lower Pacific Heights, where rents rose 10 percent over last year to an average of $3,630 for a one-bedroom. In general, though, prices rose the most in the city’s least-expensive neighborhoods. Bayview was up almost 8 percent to $2,750 and the Tenderloin was up over 6 percent to $2,550.

“People are looking for a better deal, even if it’s further away from the bustling city center,” said Chen.

Even with some large dips in certain areas, the city’s prices are still up by 4 percent overall, according to Zumper. That’s one reason why, if you are looking to make a move, you may want to do it now rather than waiting for prices to fall further. Another is the expected rise in rents during the more-competitive summer season, which is fast approaching.

“Though it is the slower moving months right now, it’d be surprising if these expensive neighborhoods stayed flat when everyone’s moving during the hot summer months and more of a demand is generated,” she advises.
