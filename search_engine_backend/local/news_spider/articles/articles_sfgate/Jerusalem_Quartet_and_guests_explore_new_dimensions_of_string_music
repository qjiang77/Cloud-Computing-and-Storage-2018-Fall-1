Jerusalem Quartet and guests explore new dimensions of string music|http://www.sfgate.com|https://datebook.sfchronicle.com/music/jerusalem-quartet-and-guests-explore-new-dimensions-of-string-music||2018-10-09|Joshua Kosman||There’s a good reason why the string quartet has been a staple of chamber music ever since Haydn worked out the basics of the plan more than 250 years ago. It’s a perfectly balanced arrangement of forces, with enough treble and bass to cover almost anything the composer has in mind.

Almost, but not quite.

Sometimes you need that little something extra — one more inner voice, a richer harmonic language or a shift in textural weight. And that’s when a string sextet comes onto the scene.

For its recital this weekend, the Jerusalem Quartet is joined by the husband-and-wife team of violinist Pinchas Zukerman and cellist Amanda Forsyth to explore some of the favorites of the string sextet repertoire. The program includes the String Sextet from Strauss’ final opera, “Capriccio,” Schoenberg’s “Verklärte Nacht” and Tchaikovsky’s “Souvenir de Florence.”

Jerusalem Quartet with Pinchas Zukerman and Amanda Forsyth: 8 p.m. Saturday, Oct. 13. $58-$86. First Congregational Church, 2345 Channing Way, Berkeley. 510-642-9988. www.calperformances.org
