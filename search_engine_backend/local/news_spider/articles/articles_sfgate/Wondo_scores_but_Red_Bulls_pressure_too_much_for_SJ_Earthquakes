Wondo scores, but Red Bulls pressure too much for SJ Earthquakes|http://www.sfgate.com/quakes|https://blog.sfgate.com/soccer/2018/10/06/wondo-scores-but-red-bulls-pressure-to-much-for-sj-earthquakes/||2018-10-06|Douglas Zimmerman||Saturday night was the tale of two teams at either end of the MLS standings. The Red Bulls came into San Jose nipping at the heels of Atlanta United for the best record in the league. Meanwhile, the Earthquakes find themselves firmly rooted at the bottom of the standings in a season they would soon like to forget, except for the MLS all-time goal scoring chase of forward Chris Wondolowski.

The game delivered exactly what a fan could expect. New York’s aggressive high pressure in the first half forced San Jose’s leaky defense to concede two goals.

“We talked about it all week that they were going to press, and we played right into it,” said Earthquakes interim coach Steve Ralston after the game.

The Red Bulls high press paid off in the 29th minute. New York defender Michael Murillo’s shot from outside the box was tipped wide by Quakes keeper James Marcinkowski. However, the ball ended up at the feet of the Red Bulls’ Alex Muyl who was able to poke the ball into the goal. Three minutes later forward Bradley Wright-Phillips headed a free kick that bounced off the far post and back onto the pitch. He collected his own rebound to score from close range and double the lead.

New York put the game out of reach when Aaron Long headed home his team’s third goal a few minutes after the break.

“They are in the Supporters’ Shield race for a reason: they are really good,” conceded Ralston. “They were better than us tonight.”

The only late drama in the match was if Wondolowski would score a goal when he subbed into the game in the 54th minute for San Jose.

The Quakes forward had a golden chance in the 70th minute when he got onto the end of a long ball. However, he pushed the shot just wide of the near post.

Wondo made amends in the 83rd minute when he headed home a Florian Jungwirth free kick past Red Bulls keeper Luis Robles.

“Yeah, it’s cool just because it’s there, it’s tangible, but it’s so frustrating losing these games, especially at home in front of these fans,” Wondolowski said about his chase for the MLS all-time goal scoring record. “To hear them all night, still cheering, still backing us is pretty special and they deserve better right now.”

His 144th career goal leaves Wondolowski only one goal shy of the all-time record set by Landon Donovan. He will have two more games this season to try and tie or break the record. The Quakes will host their final MLS home game of the season on Oct. 21st against the Colorado Rapids. They then play their last game of the season on the road Oct. 28th against the Seattle Sounders.

Quakes Notes: Eric Calvillo makes debut for San Jose Earthquakes

After being picked up from the NASL’s New York Cosmos last season, midfielder Eric Calvillo has spent the majority of the season playing for the Quakes USL affiliate team in Reno. But in the 74th minute, Calvillo made his debut for San Jose.

Calvillo has played well for Reno 1868 FC. In September he scored a game-winning goal against the LA Galaxy II which earned him USL team of the week honors.

San Jose takes a break from the MLS schedule to play host to Mexican soccer team Cruz Azul next Saturday, October 13th at 5:15 pm. Tickets are available here.
