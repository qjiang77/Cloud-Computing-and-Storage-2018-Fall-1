The fast casual concept comes courtesy of Madelyn Markoe (Tacolicious, Tres, Boxing Room) and Jessie Barker (Nopa, Tres), and theyâ€™ve set up shop at 3465 19th St.

The menu breaks down into categories of Cubanos, bowls, salads, and snacks.

The Cubanos come in four styles and run from $11.50-$12.50, with headliners like the Media Noche ($11.50: classic Cubano with ham, pork, Swiss cheese, mustard, pickles on brioche), and the Gloria ($12.50: eggplant, coconut slaw, avocado, green sauce).

The bowls, $11-$16.50 come in four varieties with combinations of roasted mojo pork shoulder, or roasted mojo chicken served with black beans and rice and coconut slaw.

The snacks, empanadas, yuca fries, croquetas, are all less than $10.

To top it off, Media Noche has $5 ice cream treats. To be more specific, they have Moon Bars, or ice cream pops, stuffed with the flavors of guava cheesecake or Cuban coffee, along with a few other ingredients.

Media Noche: 3564 19th St; Opens today; Schedule will be Wednesday through Monday from 11:30 a.m. to 10 p.m.; Hours will eventually extend to midnight
