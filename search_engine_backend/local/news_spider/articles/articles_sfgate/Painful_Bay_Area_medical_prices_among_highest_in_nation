When it comes to the price of housing, food and other necessities, the Bay Area typically tops out as one of the priciest regions in the U.S. So maybe it shouldn’t come as much of a surprise that the cost of going to the doctor or getting your cholesterol checked would also be among the highest in the country.

But health care costs are a fickle thing. Prices for various services range wildly — even within the same geographical region — and their lack of transparency makes trying to understand them or reining them in challenging for health care experts, let alone consumers.

San Francisco’s Castlight Health released a survey of the actual cost of eight popular medical procedures and tests in 30 cities across the country, based primarily on employer medical claims data. The Bay Area market, defined in the study as San Francisco, Oakland and the Silicon Valley, has some of the highest prices, but what’s notable is the how many regions outside the Bay Area with much lower costs of living have even higher health prices or consistently rank in the top tier. Check out how the Bay Area’s health prices (defined as how much the employee pays plus the cost paid by the employer) compares with other regions on these common procedures.
