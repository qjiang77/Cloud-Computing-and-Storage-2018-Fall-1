Yes, this has been a tire fire of a season for the San Francisco Giants. However, if we put our long-sleeve fire-retardant gloves on, is there anything we can pull out of this season? Turns out there is. Here are five positive take-aways from 2017:

The bullpen – An all-out mess last year and ultimately it was the Giants’ undoing in the playoff series against the eventual title-winning Cubs. However, the team could repair the bullpen quickly next season with a hopefully healthy Mark Melancon (forearm surgery) and Will Smith (Tommy John). Kyle Crick also looks like a bona fide prospect after showing well this season.

The Pablo Sandoval decision – Sandoval’s atrocious hitting is actually a good thing. It means the Giants know they can’t rely on him next season, and that the team has to do something to find a third baseman. Apparently the team will be looking into power-hitting Royals third baseman Mike Moustakas.

Chris Stratton – The young has showed promise with an ERA just under four so far this season. As a starter in August, he surrendered just four runs in 23 and two-thirds of an inning. He could figure in the team’s bullpen or maybe even as a fifth starter next year.

Christian Arroyo – He began the season with a bang, but injuries deprived the Giants on the long look they wanted to get at the young third baseman. While the Giants will examine the free agent market at third base, Arroyo is not a bad fallback option. Also, the team has long struggled to lure free agents because of California’s high taxes and the difficulty finding power at expansive AT&T.

Austin Slater – Before he tore an abductor muscle on July 6, Slater showed promise as a hitter. Through his first 37 at bats, he hit .405. However, he cooled greatly over his next 62 AB’s and wound hitting .222 before the injury. The league adjusted to Slater, now the question is can he adjust back? However, he does give the Giants some hope for the future.
