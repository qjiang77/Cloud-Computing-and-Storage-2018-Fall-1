Since taking over the program in 1984, Clark has directed the Bears to 26 national titles and mentored 131 All-Americans. He boasts all-time records of 628-80-5 in 15s and 103-14 in 7s.

Other inductees are Brent Burns (men’s track and field), Mike Deleray (men’s soccer), Steve DeVries (men’s tennis), Vikki Laing (women’s golf), Mark McNamara (men’s basketball), Veronica Nelson (softball) and Jerrott Willard (football).

Induction ceremonies are Nov. 4 at the annual Hall of Fame banquet at the Greek Orthodox Church Conference Center in Oakland. The 2016 class will also be honored at halftime of Cal’s Nov. 5 football game against Washington at Memorial Stadium.

This group brings the Cal Athletic Hall of Fame to 287 individuals and six rowing teams.
