Just in time for the impending holiday season, a cute-as-a-Christmas-card cottage has come to market. The red siding and white gingerbread trim—with tree-shaped cutouts on the wood shutters—creates a ski retreat feeling right in the heart of Eureka Valley. Even the address at 169 Yukon Street evokes images of snowy mountains and dense forests.

But the covered front porch, which adds much-needed living space to the home’s 748 square feet, speaks to the neighborhood’s considerably warmer climate. There is an even larger outdoor space behind the home with a stone patio and raised planter bed.

Inside, the one-bedroom, one-bath 1910 home has been completely remodeled and freshly painted. The bedroom is located at the front of the home, directly off the entry and across the hall from the clawfoot tub bathroom.

The living room and dining room are at the back of the home. But those without a need for a formal dining room could create a second bedroom out of that space by closing it off from the kitchen. The kitchen is actually one of the most spacious rooms in the house and has been outfitted with stainless steel appliances, white subway tiles, a farm sink and a raw-edge wood bar that provides an additional dining option.

All of the major remodeling work, including a systems overhaul and structural upgrades, was performed by the previous owner, who sold the property to the current owner for $690,000 back in 2012. Only six years later, and without much changed aside from the interior paint colors, the asking price has nearly doubled to $1,195,000.
