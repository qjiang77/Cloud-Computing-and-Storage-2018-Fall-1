A snail that has Homeland Security worried|http://blog.sfgate.com|http://blog.sfgate.com/cjohnson/2015/12/18/a-snail-that-has-homeland-security-worried/||2015-12-18|Chip Johnson||You’d think a pair of snails found on wooden pallets at the Port of Oakland wouldn’t amount to a national threat.

Think again.

These were live Giant African snails — and no need to wonder about the name. They’re ravenous land snails that can grow to 8 inches in length and 5 inches in diameter, and they eat 500 types of plants, paint and stucco and carry disease that can cause meningitis in humans. So yes, they can eat your house. But they can also threaten California agriculture, so authorities from Homeland Security are doing everything they can to make sure they don’t invade the Golden State.

The invasive species was found at the Port of Oakland this month — with a bunch of eggs — by U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents who were inspecting the docks. They were found on wooden pallets that originated in American Samoa, said Frank Falcon, √a spokesman for the federal agency.

The specimens were sent to the U.S. Department of Agriculture for tests, Falcon said. The container carrying the snails was sealed and sterilized before being off-loaded, he added.
