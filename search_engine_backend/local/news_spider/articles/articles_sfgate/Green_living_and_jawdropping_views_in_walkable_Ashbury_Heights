If you’re going to live atop a San Francisco hill, in a family-friendly neighborhood near Buena Vista Park and Golden Gate Park, you’ve got to have views. And you’ve got to have lots of outdoor space to enjoy those views, as well as an indoor space that brings it all in.

This beautifully articulated, environmentally responsible home in Buena Vista/Ashbury Heights gives you all that and more. You know you’ve found an oasis as soon as you step into the sheltered entry garden and patio, filled with native and fragrant plantings, fruit trees, and herbs.

Inside, this California modern home features an open floor plan. The expansive living area offers rich hardwood floors and a fireplace that separates the living and dining area from the kitchen. A wall of windows fills the home with natural light, while custom shelves add an artistic touch.

The heart of the home, the kitchen, is a dream for gourmet chefs and busy families alike. Professional-grade stainless-steel appliances complement sleek, slate-gray cabinetry and natural-stone countertops.

The level below features three of the home’s four bedrooms. The master suite is clad in cherry wood and European finishes. The shared bath, one of three in the home, stands out with its exquisite tile work, deep soaking tub, and extra storage. A useful laundry and storage room off the garage serves as a mudroom when going from vehicle to home.

The main level features a fourth room that you can use as a guest bedroom, home office, or den. With views of the garden and custom California closet, it’s an ideal space to rest, relax, or focus. It’s paired with a contemporary bath styled with cherry wood, a custom tile shower, glass-tile backsplash, and modern accents.

When you want to enjoy San Francisco’s temperate climate, retreat to the spacious patio with hot tub and lounge area. You have more than enough room for a grill and seating for outdoor entertaining.
