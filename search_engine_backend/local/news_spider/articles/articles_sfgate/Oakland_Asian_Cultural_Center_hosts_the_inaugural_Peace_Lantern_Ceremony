The Oakland Asian Cultural Center, or OACC, hosted the event.

The non-profit’s organizers aim to foster intergenerational dialogue and collaboration through Asian and Pacific Islander arts and cultural programming that they host.

The ceremony fell on the Sunday between the United Nations’ International Day of Peace, a day historically used as a ceasefire within combat zones and celebrated on September 21, and the Mid-Autumn Festival, a harvest festival celebrated on September 24 in several Asian countries including China and Vietnam.
