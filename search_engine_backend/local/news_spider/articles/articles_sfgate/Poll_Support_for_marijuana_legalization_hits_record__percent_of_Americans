Poll: Support for marijuana legalization hits record 62 percent of Americans|http://www.sfgate.com/cannabis|https://blog.sfgate.com/smellthetruth/2018/10/08/poll-support-for-marijuana-legalization-hits-record-62-percent-of-americans/?search=cannabis||2018-10-08|Oscar Pascual||The U.S. percentage of support for marijuana law reform has reached a record high.

More than 6 in 10 Americans support legalizing marijuana, according to a new poll conducted by the Pew Research Center.

Of the 1,750 people administered in late September, 62 percent of all Americans agreed that cannabis should be legalized.

The survey found support within most existing generations, as the majority of millennials (74 percent), Generation X (63 percent), and baby boomers (54 percent) were all in favor. Only the Silent Generation born between 1928-1945 preferred cannabis prohibition, with only 39 percent in favor of legalization.

However, there was more contention when looking at political parties and religious evangelicals. Republicans are divided at 45 percent in favor and 51 percent opposed to legalization, while only 43 percent of evangelicals are in support.

Pew’s findings are a small increase over a Fox News poll conducted earlier this year, which found 59 percent of registered voters in support legalizing cannabis for adult use.

“The fact that support continues to grow as states have been ending marijuana prohibition over the past few years suggests Americans are comfortable with the changes that are taking place,” said Mason Tvert, a spokesman for the Marijuana Policy Project, to the Marijuana Moment. “They see cannabis being sold legally in regulated businesses and they recognize it is a much more preferable system. The idea of arresting and punishing adults for consuming marijuana is becoming increasingly unpopular, and elected officials are taking notice.”
