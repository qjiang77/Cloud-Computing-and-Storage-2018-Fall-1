Mac Sabbath offers fast-food-themed take on heavy metal|http://www.sfgate.com/music|https://datebook.sfchronicle.com/music/mac-sabbath-offers-fast-food-themed-take-on-heavy-metal||2018-10-17|Aidin Vaziri,Joshua Kosman,Ryan Kost,Emma Heath||Hear us out before you run away screaming: Yes, Mac Sabbath is a McDonald’s-themed Black Sabbath cover band. But if you think grown men in homemade Hamburglar and Mayor McCheese costumes can’t rock, we invite you to pop open YouTube and check out their take on “Iron Man,” remade as “Frying Pan.”

People are still talking about the band’s set on one of the tiny side stages at Outside Lands a few years back — and you’ll want to make sure to catch them before they become headliners.

Mac Sabbath performs a Halloween show at the Great American Music Hall on Wednesday, Oct. 31; and another at the Ritz in San Jose on Thursday, Nov. 1.
