Stanford soccer: Morris to skip senior season to turn pro|http://blog.sfgate.com|http://blog.sfgate.com/stanfordsports/2016/01/05/stanford-soccer-morris-to-skip-senior-season-to-turn-pro/||2016-01-05|Tom Fitzgerald||It wasn’t much of a surprise when Stanford soccer star Jordan Morris announced Tuesday he’ll forgo his senior season to turn pro.

The Pac-12 Player of the Year had a career-high 13 goals in 18 games for Stanford this season, during which the Cardinal won the first national championship in the program’s history.

Morris will be in St. Louis for the MAC Hermann Trophy ceremony on Friday. He’s one of three finalists with Georgetown forward Brandon Allen and Creighton forward Fabian Herbers. Then he’ll join Werder Bremen for a training stint at that team’s camp in southern Turkey. His MLS rights are owned by Seattle; he has played for the Sounders FC Academy.

He was the Most Outstanding Player at the College Cup, using his blistering speed and superb skills to score two goals in Stanford’s 4-0 rout of Clemson in the title game. It was the first multi-goal performance by a player in the title game in 18 years.

The junior forward missed five games because of his responsibilities with U.S. Soccer, splitting time between the senior team and the Under-23s. He made six appearances with the senior team, during which he scored against Mexico on April 15 and assisted on the winning goal against the Netherland on June 5. He also earned 11 caps with the U-23s, collecting six goals and assists.
