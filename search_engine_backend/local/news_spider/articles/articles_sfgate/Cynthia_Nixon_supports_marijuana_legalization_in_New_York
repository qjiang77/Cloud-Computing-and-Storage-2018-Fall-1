Cynthia Nixon supports marijuana legalization in New York|http://www.sfgate.com/cannabis|https://blog.sfgate.com/smellthetruth/2018/04/04/cynthia-nixon-supports-marijuana-legalization-in-new-york/?search=cannabis||2018-04-04|Oscar Pascual||Cynthia Nixon would enthusiastically move to legalize marijuana if she were elected New York governor.

The actress and Democratic gubernatorial candidate, best known for her role as Miranda from television’s Sex and the City, told supporters at a recent fundraiser that she plans to legalize recreational marijuana for adults in order to generate more revenue for the state, reports the New York Times.

Nixon reportedly pumped her fist and said “Yes!” when a guest asked her about the possibility of legalizing cannabis.

Her pro-legalization stance is at odds with current Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who not only opposes a legal program, but also continues to perpetuate myths about cannabis that have long been debunked.

“It’s a gateway drug, and marijuana leads to other drugs and there’s a lot of proof that that’s true,” Cuomo said to reporters in a 2017 public appearance. “There’s two sides to the argument. But I, as of this date, I am unconvinced on recreational marijuana.”

She has since doubled down on her legalization platform in an appearance on The Wendy Williams Show on Wednesday, her first interview since announcing her bid for governor on March 19.

“I’m absolutely for the legalization of marijuana,” Nixon said. “Let’s capture some of that revenue.”
