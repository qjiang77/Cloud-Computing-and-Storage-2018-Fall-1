The BASIC fund is on a mission to change that. With donations from Bay Areans like you, they’re able to broaden the educational opportunities for low-income families across the Bay Area by providing partial tuition scholarships to a private K-8 school of their choice.

In fact, since the BASIC fund granted its first scholarship in 1998, over 20,000 children have been helped to attend a private school in the Bay Area. In the 2016/17 school year, more than 3,500 students will receive a BASIC Fund scholarship to attend one of more than 270 schools across the nine Bay Area counties.

What happens to those children who receive a scholarship? They succeed with flying colors. BASIC Fund recipients graduate from high school at a rate of 98% and enter college at a rate of 92%. Compare that to the average high school graduation rates of closer to 65% from the low-income, minority population in San Francisco and Oakland, and it’s clear the life-changing opportunities a child receives from some financial assistance.

But the scholarship rewards don’t end at the grantees. Nine schools in the Bay Area receive more than $100,000 per year from the BASIC Fund, and without this support, these schools, which are integral to their communities, would struggle to stay open.

Founded by Jim and June McCarthy, with key investments from Arthur Rock and the late John Walton, the BASIC Fund has raised over $114 million since it began. BASIC Fund supporters and board members are corporate and community leaders who receive little publicity for the work they do to help low-income children receive a quality education. The BASIC Fund does not host fund-raising events, and 100% of its operating costs are covered by the board, so donations go straight to scholarships each year.

Donate today to help give Bay Area children the education they deserve. You’ll be giving scholarship recipients and their families a future full of opportunities they otherwise may not have been able to achieve:

“Because of your support, I have had the privilege to take hold of my education. I thank you for giving us something no one can ever take away: hope and the courage to strive and reach whatever we aspire to be.” – Scholarship recipient
