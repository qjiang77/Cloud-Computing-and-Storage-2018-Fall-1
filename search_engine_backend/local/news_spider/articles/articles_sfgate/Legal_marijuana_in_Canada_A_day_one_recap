Legal marijuana in Canada: A day one recap|http://www.sfgate.com/cannabis|https://blog.sfgate.com/smellthetruth/2018/10/18/legal-marijuana-in-canada-a-day-one-recap/?search=cannabis||2018-10-18|Oscar Pascual||Canada has celebrated its first day of cannabis legalization, which was quite remarkable.

The country on Wednesday became the first country with a major world economy to legalize cannabis for adult recreational use, the New York Times reports.

The country’s new weed laws marks a historic moment for residents such as Montreal’s Tonino Ruggiero, who told the Washington Post, “This is better than the Olympics. Not as good as the Rolling Stones, but close.”

A group of Newfoundland residents have the distinction of being the country’s first pot consumers, purchasing packs of Aurora’s prerolls at 12:01 local time.

Several popular marijuana stocks are now on the rise due to the momentous occasion, including Aurora Cannabis Inc., which plans to go public on the New York Stock Exchange on Oct. 23.

“After nearly 100 years of federal prohibition, we can proudly say that the re-legalization of cannabis in Canada has finally arrived,” said Aurora’s Chief Global Business Development Officer Neil Belot in an email to Smell the Truth.

Not everything involving cannabis is legal, as acts such as buying edibles or public consumption remain prohibited. CTV News released a list of things that are still illegal to help navigate the new rules.

Late Show host Stephen Colbert chimed in on the momentous event by offering a 420-friendly tourism ad. Anyone who’s actually planning a Canadian cannabis vacation might be a bit disappointed, however, until the country opens more dispensaries, MarketWatch points out.

Lastly, many Canadian hip-hop fans were quick to point out that legalization came about on Gucci Mane Day.
