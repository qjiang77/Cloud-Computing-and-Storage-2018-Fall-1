San Francisco Batman|http://blog.sfgate.com|http://blog.sfgate.com/cityexposed/2015/04/05/batman/||2015-04-05|Mike Kepka||A recent Monday, 9:58 a.m.: Coasting past pedestrians in a city as strange as Gotham, Batman spots a woman in distress and offers her a ride in his pedicab.

“Batman rescued me and brought me down to the pier,” said JoAnn Garlington of Concord, who came into the city to meet a friend who had arrived on a cruise ship. “I walked from the BART station, and my feet were about to give out.”

Two hours later, San Francisco natives Tony Toy and Jackie Baldinger jump in the back of the Dark Knight’s black pedal-powered chariot. With his cape flapping in front of them, they saw their city in way they never had before.

“It was awesome,” said Toy. “I’ve never ridden with Batman before. It was a privilege.”

“He’s a hero,” said Baldinger. “He saves people from walking long distances.”
