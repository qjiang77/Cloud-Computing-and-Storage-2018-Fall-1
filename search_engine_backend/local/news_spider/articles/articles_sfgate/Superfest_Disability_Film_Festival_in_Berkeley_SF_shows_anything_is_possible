Superfest Disability Film Festival in Berkeley, SF shows anything is possible|http://www.sfgate.com|https://datebook.sfchronicle.com/movies-tv/superfest-disability-film-festival-in-berkeley-sf-shows-anything-is-possible||2018-10-15|G. Allen Johnson,Peter Hartlaub,Pam Grady,Jessica Zack,Jacqueline Cutler||A young woman has an opportunity to “cure” her deafness through an experimental medical procedure in “This Is Normal.” Her dilemma: “Is it worth giving up who you’ve been for who you could become?”

Another woman, climber Maureen Beck, scales mountains despite being born without a lower left arm in “Stumped.”

Those are just two of the stories told during the two-day Superfest Disability Film Festival on Saturday, Oct. 20, at the Magnes Collection of Jewish Art and Life in Berkeley and Sunday, Oct. 21, at the Contemporary Jewish Museum in San Francisco.

The traveling film festival began in Los Angeles in 1970, and San Francisco’s Lighthouse for the Blind and Visually Impaired and the Paul K. Longmore Institute on Disability at San Francisco State have been longtime co-sponsors. Superfest bills itself as one of the few festivals worldwide that is completely accessible to filmgoers with disabilities.

Superfest Disability Film Festival: Saturday, Oct. 20, at the Magnes Collection of Jewish Art and Life, 2121 Allston Way, Berkeley. 510-643-2526; Sunday, Oct. 21, at the Contemporary Jewish Museum, 736 Mission St., S.F. 415-655-7800. www.superfestfilm.com
