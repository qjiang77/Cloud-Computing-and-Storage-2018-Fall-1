Watch: Neil deGrasse Tyson advises against smoking weed in space|http://www.sfgate.com/cannabis|https://blog.sfgate.com/smellthetruth/2018/09/13/watch-neil-degrasse-tyson-advises-against-smoking-weed-in-space/?search=cannabis||2018-09-13|Oscar Pascual||Smoking weed might decrease your chances of surviving in space, according to Neil deGrasse Tyson.

The TV host and noted astrophysicist recently gave TMZ his reasons for avoiding the ganja while traversing the final frontier.

The TMZ reporter asked what it would be like to smoke weed in space, and Tyson gave him a sobering answer, which can be viewed in the video below.

“Well, the problem is, in space now, many things will kill you,” he said. “So if you do anything to alter your understanding of what is reality, that’s not in the interest of your health.”

Tyson then described the only instance where it could be acceptable to light up while in orbit.

“So if you want to get high in space, like lock yourself in your cabin and don’t come out because you could break stuff inadvertently. OK? That’s how that goes.”

Tyson’s sagely advice came after he was asked about Tesla CEO Elon Musk and his pot-smoking antics while appearing on Joe Rogan’s podcast.

“I think—can they leave him alone?” Tyson said. “Let the man get high if he wants to get high.”

Despite advising against intergalactic smoke sessions, Tyson has vocally advocated for legalizing cannabis.
