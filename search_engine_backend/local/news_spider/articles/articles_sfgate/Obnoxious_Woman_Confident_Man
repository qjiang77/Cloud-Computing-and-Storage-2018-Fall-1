Obnoxious Woman, Confident Man|http://www.sfgate.com/movies|https://blog.sfgate.com/mlasalle/2018/09/30/how-women-are-allowed-to-act/||2018-09-30|Mick Lasalle||I’ve told this story many times, but never in print, at least so far as I remember.

When I was 16, I went into the bathroom to take a shower and turned on the radio. There was a woman being interviewed, apparently a musician, and after listening to her talk about how great she was, I thought, “Wow. She’s obnoxious. She’s really stuck on herself.”

I got out of the shower and listened some more, and after another minute or so, I realized the woman wasn’t a woman, after all. It was Neil Sedaka, a fairly high-voiced man who was enjoying a second flowering in his career at around that time (the mid-70s). I dried off and got dressed, and continued to listen, and as I did, I realized that he didn’t sound obnoxious at all, just confident and very much into what he was doing.

And that’s when it hit me. I realized that what I considered to be acceptable in a woman and what I considered to be acceptable in a man were different, that behavior I considered obnoxious in a woman I took for granted in a man and even regarded as admirable. And I thought — well, this isn’t right. If he wasn’t obnoxious as Neil Sedaka, then a woman who acted that way wasn’t obnoxious, either. I had to adjust my way of thinking. The problem here was me.

That was over 40 years ago, and I’d like to believe the world has changed. But I don’t really think it has, at least not much.
