Anne Brigman, a proto-feminist photographer, gets her due at Nevada Museum|http://www.sfgate.com/art|https://datebook.sfchronicle.com/art-exhibits/anne-brigman-a-proto-feminist-photographer-gets-her-due-at-nevada-museum||2018-10-12|Charles Desmarais,Ryan Kost,Emma Heath,Brandon Yu||Historians of photography have long revered the work of Anne Brigman (1869-1950), even if her name was not widely known by the public. An expansive exhibition at the Nevada Museum of Art in Reno aims to change that and, in the process, establish a claim for her significance as a proto-feminist artist.

Brigman spent her creative years at the center of early 20th century bohemian circles in the East Bay, living in a cabin on Oakland’s 32nd Street and teaching at her studio in Berkeley. Her early fame as a photographer was only enhanced by the censorship, in 1908, of her self-portrait “Soul of the Blasted Pine.”

Not all Chronicle readers will find a trip to Reno convenient before Jan. 27, when the show closes. While not a substitute for the original art, the spectacularly produced catalog (Rizzoli Electa, 400 pages, $100) is a worthy second-best way to learn about the artist, who wrote in 1913, “My pictures tell of my freedom of soul, my emancipation from fear.”
