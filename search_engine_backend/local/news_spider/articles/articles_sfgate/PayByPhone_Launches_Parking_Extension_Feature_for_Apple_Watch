San Francisco drivers can now extend their parking without a mobile phone.

SAN FRANCISCO, CA

Drivers who use PayByPhone can now extend their parking from the Apple Watch. This new feature is supported by watch OS 4.0 and above and enables drivers to park without using their phone or having to make a trip to the meter. The Apple Watch app also includes the ‘Glances’ feature, which shows drivers the amount of time they have remaining in their parking session.

PayByPhone was one of 44 companies originally chosen to launch with the Apple Watch which is now installed on over 260,000 watches globally. This past June, PayByPhone’s Apple Watch experience was showcased at Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference, a parking industry first and a huge achievement for PayByPhone.





“The recognition is a true testament to PayByPhone’s technology and the exceptional people behind it. We continue to put our clients and consumers at the heart of everything we do and look forward to defining the future of parking and mobility as a word-class mobile solution,” remarked Andy Gruber, PayByPhone CEO.

PayByPhone is available in cities across North America, the United Kingdom, France, Australia, and Switzerland, and assists 17 million registered users pay for their parking in seconds. In the City of San Francisco, the app can be found at 30,000 on-street locations.
