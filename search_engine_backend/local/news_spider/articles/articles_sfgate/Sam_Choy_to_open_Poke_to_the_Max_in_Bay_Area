Sam Choy to open Poke to the Max in Bay Area|http://blog.sfgate.com|https://blog.sfgate.com/hawaii/2018/10/11/sam-choys-poke-to-the-max-top-o-bay-area/||2018-10-11|Jeanne Cooper||Hawaii celebrity chef Sam Choy, hailed as the Godfather of Poke, no longer has eponymous restaurants in the islands where he rose to fame, but he has found fertile ground on the West Coast, first in Seattle and soon in the Bay Area.

Poke to the Max, the chef’s first California dining room opens Saturday, Oct. 13, at 629 San Mateo Ave., San Bruno. Choy will visit for the opening weekend and greet patrons before turning the helm over to former Google chef and island food connoisseur Wade Tamura. A fleet of food trucks under the same name are expected to follow shortly after.

Despite the name, Poke to the Max will offer a range of “local” food, as it’s called in Hawaii, including musubis and plate lunches featuring entrees such as loco moco, kalua pork and shoyu chicken as well as a variety of poke and innovative dishes. The interior will be a blend of traditional poke displays in glass deli cases and contemporary restaurant design. “Poke to the Max is a true taste of Hawaii. Our mission has always been to bring poke to the people and that’s what we will continue to do,” Choy said in a press release.

Although he no longer runs Sam Choy-branded restaurants in Hawaii, the chef helped develop the menu at Holoholo Grill at Koloa Landing on Kauai in 2017 (subject of a story last fall in the Chronicle) and put his name on specialty menus for American Airlines’ flights to Hawaii.

Poke to the Max will be open 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. Tuesday-Saturday and 11 a.m. to 6 p.m Sunday (closed Monday); the phone number is (650) 763-0763. Its social media accounts are currently shared with the Seattle and Tacoma, Wash., locations; follow on Instagram at @samchoyspoke and Facebook at Sam Choy’s Poke.
