At less than 2,000 square feet of finished space, 4376 21st isn’t a huge home. But its interior space is greatly supplemented by its outdoor amenities, including a terrace, patio, two decks and grassy green lawns.

The home is located on the corner of 21st Street and Grand View Avenue, about six blocks from the heart of Noe Valley and a few blocks from the Seward Slides. It has more privacy than the typical corner home because the outdoor space is both surrounded by wall and elevated one floor above 21st Street.

In fact, the main entry of the home is a blue wood door on 21st that leads to an adorable arbored staircase. A big deck overlooking the street sits on top of the one-car garage below and adds additional entertaining space to the living area on this floor. At the rear of this level is an eat-in kitchen with doors out to a patio, terrace and two lawn areas.

There’s a full bathroom on this level as well as one above on the bedroom level. There’s no true master since the upper-level bath serves all three bedrooms, but the largest bedroom at the rear of the home comes pretty close. It has two walk-in closets and a huge deck. The other two bedrooms are decidedly smaller, though one has access to a loft above for additional storage space, or, according to the marketing site, a “hideaway reading spot.”

The site also says that although the home itself was built in 1898, the lower garage level was built out into a family room/guest area with its own street-level entrance in 2015. A full bathroom was also added on this level just this year. The remodeled kitchen has also been outfitted with stainless steel appliances and quartz countertops. But the Victorian home also maintains its “storybook” wood-shingled facade, inlaid wood floors and coved ceilings.

The price for all these modern touches combined with historic charm and singular city outdoor space? $2.55 million.
