Marijuana can help treat symptoms from multiple sclerosis, study finds|http://www.sfgate.com/cannabis|https://blog.sfgate.com/smellthetruth/2018/10/16/marijuana-can-help-treat-symptoms-from-multiple-sclerosis-study-finds/?search=cannabis||2018-10-16|Oscar Pascual||Multiple sclerosis (MS) could be yet another illness that could benefit from medical marijuana, according to new research.

A study published this week in the journal JAMA Network Open found that “cannabinoids produce a limited and mild reduction of subjective spasticity, pain, and bladder dysfunction in patients with MS.”

Spanish researchers conducted a meta-analysis of 17 existing clinical trials, all of which involving 3,161 patients with MS, who took products containing some form of cannabinoids, the compounds found within cannabis.

“The results suggest a limited efficacy of cannabinoids for the treatment of spasticity, pain, and bladder dysfunction in patients with MS. Therapy using these drugs can be considered as safe,” the researchers wrote.

The new findings build upon a 2015 study by Tel Aviv University that found THC and CBD compounds found in marijuana can treat inflammation associated with MS.

The former talk show host Montel Williams has advocated for the use of medical cannabis, which he uses to treat his own MS symptoms.

“The review and the editorial confirm that cannabis-based medicines are moderately effective for treating some symptoms of MS, but also highlight the need for more well-designed studies which test the different components of cannabis,” a spokesperson from the Multiple Sclerosis Trust told Newsweek.
