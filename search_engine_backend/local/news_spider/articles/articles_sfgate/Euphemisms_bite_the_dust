Euphemisms bite the dust|http://blog.sfgate.com|http://blog.sfgate.com/politics/2017/03/14/euphemisms-bite-the-dust/||2017-03-14|Bob Egelko||Readers of the latest judicial adventures of President Trump’s impending travel ban might have noticed that The Chronicle’s accounts — by this writer, anyway — no longer refer to the six nations targeted for U.S. entry bans as “predominantly Muslim” or “Muslim-majority.”

A little fact-checking found that those terms aren’t so much inaccurate as seriously understated.

According to a January 2011 Pew Research report, Syria’s population was about 90 percent Muslim and 10 percent Christian. The numbers for the other nations covered by the executive order were much higher: Libya, 96.6 percent Muslim; Sudan, 97 percent; Somalia, 98.9 percent; Yemen, 99 percent, and Iran, 99.7 percent. Iraq, which was named in Trump’s first executive order on Jan. 27 but was dropped from the revised order he issued March 6, was 98.9 percent Muslim.

The order, due to take effect Thursday unless courts again block it, would impose a 90-day ban on entry to the United States of anyone from the six countries, except for those who are legal U.S. residents or hold valid U.S. visas. It would also halt all U.S. admission of refugees for 120 days.

Looking for a new descriptor for the nations’ populations, the reporter and his advisers concluded that calling them “Muslim” countries was probably too simplistic, and “overwhelmingly Muslim” might seem a bit loaded. So for now, unless someone comes up with a better term, they’ll be “almost entirely Muslim” or words to that effect.

Stay tuned for further developments.
