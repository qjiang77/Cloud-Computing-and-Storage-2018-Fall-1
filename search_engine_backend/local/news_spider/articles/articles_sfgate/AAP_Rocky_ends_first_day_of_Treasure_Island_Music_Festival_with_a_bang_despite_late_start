A$AP Rocky ends first day of Treasure Island Music Festival with a bang, despite late start|http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment|https://datebook.sfchronicle.com/music/aap-rocky-ends-first-day-of-treasure-island-music-festival-with-a-bang-despite-late-start||2018-10-14|Mariecar Mendoza,Aidin Vaziri,Chronicle Staff,Andrew Gilbert||The Treasure Island Music Festival’s first day back after a yearlong hiatus — this time at Oakland’s Middle Harbor Shoreline Park — was off to a smooth start, with nearly all of its sets on Saturday, Oct. 13, starting and ending right on time. That is until A$AP Rocky broke the festival’s streak by showing up more than 30 minutes late to the Town Stage.

But the New York rapper, who showed up just before 9 p.m. (he was scheduled for 8:25 p.m.), quickly made it up to them with a performance that lit up the night — literally.

A$AP Rocky, sporting his signature braids and a Marvin the Martian shirt, ran through bangers off his latest album, “Testing,” like “F— Sleep” and “Praise the Lord (Da Shine),” complete with a saxophone player. All the while, jets of smoke and fire shot out at the edge of the stage as he hopped around in front of a giant crash test dummy head.

As if a nod to San Francisco’s hippie roots, A$AP Rocky performed “LSD” atop the dummy head as a psychedelic light show was projected over the entire stage.

He also showed love to the Bay Area by giving a shout-out to Lil B, sampling one of Berkeley rapper’s tracks before cutting it out to clarify that “just so y’all know, BasedGod ain’t coming out.”

“This is a celebration of my man. … I f—in’ love BasedGod, as a matter of fact,” he continued. “If it wasn’t for Lil B a lot of these n— wouldn’t even be birthed or rappin’ or none of this s—. I pay homage to real n— and legends and all that.”

A$AP Rocky wanted to show respect to his fans, too. Several times during the set he stopped midsong to start over — particularly during tracks where he had to do that “singy-songy s—.”

“I didn’t come all the way to San Francisco to be short-changing these people,” he said. “I love you too much for that.”

Then with three minutes left onstage, A$AP Rocky jumped into “Yamborghini High,” told everyone to get home safe and set off a fireworks show that must’ve had neighbors nearby wondering if the Warriors were playing a home game.

“This s— has been electrifying. I love y’alls energy,” he told fans. “Thank you for this love. I really appreciate that.”
