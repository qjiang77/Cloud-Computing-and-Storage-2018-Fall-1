Canada is reportedly running short on legal marijuana|http://www.sfgate.com/cannabis|https://blog.sfgate.com/smellthetruth/2018/10/19/canada-is-reportedly-running-short-on-legal-marijuana/?search=cannabis||2018-10-19|Oscar Pascual||Canada is running dry on cannabis just days after the country historically legalized recreational marijuana for adult use, reports CBC News.

Dubbed as “Weed Wednesday,” many dispensaries opened as soon as midnight struck on Oct. 17. However, many shops such as THC Distribution in Portugal Cove-St Philip’s ran out of product just after 4 p.m.

Owner Thomas Clarke predicted the store would be completely out of product by Friday.

“It’s very bad news in my eyes. I ran out at 4:20 today, believe it or not,” Clarke told CBC News. “I’m a little shocked that I sold out so fast, and also very upset that I don’t have product for everybody. I’m letting down a lot of people here and I was assured that if I paid for the cannabis I would receive it.”

Gary Symons, communications director for a Winnipeg retailer, told the Globe and Mail that they sold $50,000 of their product in the first hour, and were out of stock by the early morning.

The problem isn’t just related to the amount of supply, but also the newly implemented regulations for selling commercial pot. Some crops have been deemed unfit by Health Canada, while some suppliers are waiting for Health Canada-approved packaging.

As one disgruntled customer explained to the Montreal Gazette, “for me, the score is: black market, 1; government, zero.”

In the meantime, dispensary owners such as Clarke must wait patiently until more cannabis arrives.

“I pray that something gets shipped to me overnight so I’ll have some product for tomorrow. If I don’t get any product I’m going to keep the shop closed and spend a couple of days with my family,” he said.
