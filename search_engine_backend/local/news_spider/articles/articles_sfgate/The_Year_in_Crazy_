The Year in Crazy: 2014|http://blog.sfgate.com|http://blog.sfgate.com/fiore/2015/01/01/the-year-in-crazy-2014/||2015-01-01|Mark Fiore||2014 saw everything from a mooching rancher and his well-armed militia buddies fighting off the federal government to the killing of an unarmed black man sparking a nationwide conversation on race. Corporations went from having free speech to now having freedom of religion, too. Money continued to pour into our elections and campaign advertising continued on it’s downward (or upward, depending on your perspective) spiral. There were way too many guns, bombs and crazies in 2014, a trend that will probably continue in 2015.

Tech is still booming, with watches and other wearables, drones and the occasional twisted campaign of hatred. This is just a tiny segment of cartoon fodder from 2014. Keep coming back for more cartoons and thanks for forwarding them along to your friends and/or enemies, I couldn’t do this without you! Happy New Year and here’s to a better 2015, dammit!

This will be my last cartoon appearing on SFGate. You’ll still be able to see my cartoons on my own site and other outlets. I’ve enjoyed appearing on SFGate and want to thank Vlae Kershner and Jeanne Carstensen in particular for taking a chance on my work in the early days of online news sites. The Gate has changed substantially over the years and my work doesn’t really fit here as well as it once did. Remember, you can track me down here and follow me here or here. Thanks, and Happy New Year.
