Court: The crime is what you did, not what you could have done|http://blog.sfgate.com|http://blog.sfgate.com/crime/2016/10/28/court-the-crime-is-what-you-did-not-what-you-could-have-done/||2016-10-28|Bob Egelko||California’s Proposition 47 reduces felony convictions to misdemeanors for property crimes of less than $950. But when Jullian Rendon tried to reclassify her forgery conviction as a misdemeanor because she was caught with $260 in counterfeit bills, prosecutors objected because Rendon also possessed materials — blank pre-cut paper money, Benjamin Franklin faces and other items — that she could have used to fabricate tens of thousands of dollars in additional fake bills.

That was good enough for an El Dorado County judge, Dylan Sullivan, who kept Rendon in the books as a felony forger. But a state appeals court said Thursday that people can be punished only for the crimes they actually committed and not for what they could have done.

“Material that could be used to make counterfeit bills has no bearing on (the sentence), and blank pre-cut paper money has no face value,” Justice Ron Robie said in a 3-0 ruling of the Third District Court of Appeal ordering Rendon’s conviction reduced to a misdemeanor. “The only fictitious or altered bills or notes (Rendon) possessed that had any discernible value were the two $100 bills and the three $20 bills” she had already counterfeited.

Rendon pleaded no contest to the forgery charge and a drug possession charge in October 2014, a month before Prop. 47 passed, and has served her sentence of six months in jail and six months in a residential drug treatment program. She has other felonies on her record, but the ruling removes one of them and gives Rendon, a young mother, more of a chance to turn her life around, said her lawyer, Jyoti Malik.

Malik said prosecutors went too far in arguing for stiffer punishment based on Rendon’s potential to use the materials she had to counterfeit more money.

“I said (to the court), ‘What about a bottle of ink?’ ” the lawyer said. “You could potentially make a (bank) note. Any stationery, you have the potential for making a forged check.”
