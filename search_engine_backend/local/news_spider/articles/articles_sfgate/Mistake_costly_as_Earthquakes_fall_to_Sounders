Mistake costly as Earthquakes fall to Sounders|http://www.sfgate.com/quakes|https://blog.sfgate.com/soccer/2018/07/25/mistake-costly-as-san-jose-earthquakes-fall-to-seattle-sounders/||2018-07-25|Douglas Zimmerman||After a creditable draw on Sunday against Manchester United, it looked like the Earthquakes might be turning the corner on a dismal campaign. But a critical turnover in the second half led to a Seattle Sounders goal and another defeat for San Jose.

“I think we played well,” said Quakes midfielder Luis Felipe. “We got caught in a counterattack. We have to keep our heads up and try to win games. It’s the most important thing now.”

San Jose pressed high throughout the game looking for a full three points. They had thirteen shots with five on target. But their pressure left them open to the counter which the Sounders took advantage of in the 60th minute. A Quakes backpass went directly to the Sounders Raul Ruidiaz. Seattle quickly countered, and Ruidiaz finished the opportunity with a well-placed shot just inside the penalty area.

“We conceded a goal from out of the blue,” noted Earthquakes coach Mikael Stahre. “We tried to sub in some players to bring in some energy and change the shape up a little bit, but we hardly created any chances. Tonight we lacked quality in the final third of the field.”

The Quakes will have to quickly rebound from the loss, as they host Real Salt Lake this Saturday at 7:15 pm.
