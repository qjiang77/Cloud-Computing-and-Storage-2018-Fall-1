Why should I register?

Registration is fast and free and not required to view any SFGate editorial content.

You can add comments to articles and blogs. (View the comment support page for specific info on submitting comments. Note: Photo and video submissions are subject to pre-approval.)

You can subscribe to SFGate newsletters.

[Note: registering your SFGate username will not grant you access to the SF Chronicle iPad App or the SFChronicle.com web site.]

Register today!

OK, I&#39;m registered. Now what?

First, make sure that you responded to the confirmation message we sent to your registration email address. (If you didn&#39;t get one, you may want to check your SPAM box. For help, contact support@sfgate.com.) If you responded to this email, you are now signed in.

How can I tell if I&#39;m signed in?

The upper right corner of most of our pages will tell you if you&#39;re signed in:

If it says &quot;Sign In | Register&quot; you are not signed in. Click &quot;Sign In&quot; to do just that.

If it says &quot;Hello (username) | Sign Out&quot; you are signed in by that (username).

You can always find a way to Sign In from the SFGate home page. Look in the upper right.

Once I&#39;m signed in, now what?

(Clearing cached files: Clearing SFGate-related browser cookies and cached files, and then restarting your browser, can sometimes take care of display or login problems with SFGate&#39;s comments. Click here for more info.)
