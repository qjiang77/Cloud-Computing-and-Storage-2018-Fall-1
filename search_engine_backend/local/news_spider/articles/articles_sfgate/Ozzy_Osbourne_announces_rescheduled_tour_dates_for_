Ozzy Osbourne announces rescheduled tour dates for 2019|http://www.sfgate.com/music|https://datebook.sfchronicle.com/music/ozzy-osbourne-announces-rescheduled-tour-dates-for-2019||2018-10-17|Aidin Vaziri,Joshua Kosman,Ryan Kost,Emma Heath||Ozzy Osbourne may be down, but he’s not out.

After the Black Sabbath frontman was forced to postpone the final four dates of his North American No More Tours 2 trek to treat multiple infections in his right hand, Osbourne announced on Wednesday, Oct. 17, a series of makeup dates for 2019 — including a July 27 concert at Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View.

The 69-year-old singer was originally scheduled to perform at the South Bay venue on Oct. 6, but instead checked into Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles to undergo emergency surgery.

Osbourne is in the midst of wrapping up his “final” world tour, with the name making a reference to his initial 1992 No More Tours outing.

The other rescheduled tour dates are for July 20 at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas; July 23 at the Mattress Firm Amphitheatre in Chula Vista (San Diego County); and July 29 at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles.

Additionally, Osbourne announced that he would headline the Download Festival Japan in Chiba, Japan, on March 21.

All tickets for the previously postponed performances at Shoreline will be honored at the door at the 2019 concert. Refunds are available at point of purchase.
