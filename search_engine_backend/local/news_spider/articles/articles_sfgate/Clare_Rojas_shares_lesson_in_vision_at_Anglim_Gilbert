Clare Rojas shares lesson in vision at Anglim Gilbert|http://www.sfgate.com/art|https://datebook.sfchronicle.com/art-exhibits/clare-rojas-shares-lesson-in-vision-at-anglim-gilbert||2018-10-18|Charles Desmarais,Ryan Kost,Emma Heath,Brandon Yu||One might be forgiven for thinking the exhibition “‘Somehow there will be music’ – Jane,” which continues at Anglim Gilbert Gallery through Nov. 12, is a group show. Figurative works, in a couple of different styles, are hung among near-abstract manipulations of simple forms in dusty colors. Nearby, architectural fantasies suggest colorized versions of M.C. Escher (1898-1972), or Giovanni Battista Piranesi (1720–1778) at his most inventive. A mural-scale painting, 7 feet by 12, features an image of a pelican floating in a moonlit pool. Several sculptures, like science-museum lessons in perception, are set before paintings so that, seen from prescribed angles, their forms merge and space collapses.

For all the variety, every work in the exhibition was made by Clare Rojas, a longtime presence on the Bay Area scene. She’s an artistic shape-shifter who, nonetheless, has put together more cohesive presentations in the past. I can’t help but think this outing is meant to frustrate, or to declare her independence from, interpretation. While an enjoyable walk through a range of her preoccupations, it’s a show that goes to great lengths to explain vision, even as she holds meaning close to her chest.
