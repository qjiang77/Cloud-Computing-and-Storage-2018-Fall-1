Coffee in San Francisco has a rich history that dates back to 1873. The original founder, Austin Hills Sr. and his sons established Arabian Coffee and Spice Mills, later becoming Hills Bros. Coffee. The Hills Bros Coffee company has passed through different ownership including Nestle and Massimo Beverage. This San Francisco coffee is innovative, delicious and high quality.

Cold Brew

The Hills Bros. Cold Brew is absolutely refreshing and bold in flavor. It’s a dark roast that’s certified kosher. Add some cream and sugar for a sweet and silky drink. Don’t forget the ice for the best, chilled coffee for hot days.

100 Percent Colombian Whole Bean

This 100 percent Colombian whole bean coffee is sourced from sustainable farms. The beans are grown in high altitude and offer a deep flavor profile with some fruity tones. By purchasing whole beans, people have the chance to freshly grind the beans for the best cup of coffee possible.

Ground Pacific Blend

For coffee lovers, the Ground Pacific Blend is a real treat. It’s made with hard-to-find beans from the Pacific tropic region. Because it’s already ground, it’s easy to brew in the morning even when one is in a rush.

Morning Roast Blend

The Morning Roast Blend is inspired by the hustle and bustle of San Francisco. It’s light, acidic and fresh. Delicious on its own, it’s even better with a touch of cream and sugar.

Instant Medium Blend

The Instant Medium Blend is a terrific option for people who are constantly on-the-go. It’s a crowd pleaser, too, since it’s medium-bodied and easy to drink. The caffeine content is also mild, which is great for those who are more sensitive to caffeine.

Cappuccino

Hills Bros. offers cappuccino in canisters, packets and single-serve cups. For an extra strong cup, mix in the drink mix with coffee for a zingy drink. It’s also very good when chilled. In addition to the Classic Cappuccino, there are other flavors like French vanilla, hazelnut and more. Choose from the decaffeinated versions for a slight caffeine buzz.

Hot Cocoa

Although coffee is the best drink in the morning, check out the hot cocoa single-serve packets, ideal for kids or for a comforting drink before bed. Choose from dark chocolate or milk chocolate, depending on one’s preferences. It’s made with premium chocolate from Europe and real sugar.

Beans for Hills Bros coffee are sourced from more than 80 countries around the globe to offer people a wide variety of flavors and blends. There are both regular and decaffeinated options for all types of coffee to accommodate anyone’s preferences.
