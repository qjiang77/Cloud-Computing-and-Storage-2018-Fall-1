Cypress Hill launches new marijuana brand through online delivery service|http://www.sfgate.com/cannabis|https://blog.sfgate.com/smellthetruth/2018/10/09/cypress-hill-launches-new-marijuana-brand-through-online-delivery-service/?search=cannabis||2018-10-09|Oscar Pascual||One of music’s most outspoken cannabis advocates are now offering their own legal marijuana products.

The venerable hip-hop group Cypress Hill announced the launch of their Cypress Hill Bhang cannabis line alongside the release of their latest studio album, Elephants on Acid, according to a press release.

The CHB launch is marked by the release of two special collector’s edition products — a glass jar made to store cannabis, as well as a pre-roll stash box made in the form of a cassette tape.

The 1/4 oz. glass jar is shaped like a skull wearing a bucket hat, and comes filled with one of two top-shelf strains — Cherry Bomb or Zookies — grown by California cultivators Ember Valley. The special jar can be seen in Cypress Hill’s latest music video, “Crazy.”

“Legend has it crystal skulls are a form of computer which are able to recognize energy and vibrations that occur around them,” says Cypress Hill’s DJ Muggs. “Based on this legend, Cypress Hill and Bhang joined forces to create CHB.”

The cassette tape stash box contains 6 joints pre-rolled with the Mendo’s Breath strain, and comes in two custom styles.

Cypress Hill Bhang products will be available via delivery exclusively through bud.com, which distributes legal recreational cannabis throughout California.

CHB’s glass skull jars and stash boxes will also be available at finer dispensaries, including Abatin Wellness Sacramento, CBCB Berkeley, Phytologie Oakland, the Los Angeles Patients and Caregivers Group, and B-Real from Cypress Hill’s very own LA-based Dr. Greenthumb.
