The 10-day festival ends Saturday, Oct. 20, with its 14th annual Lit Crawl, a roving party that takes over the Mission District for several hours. In what the festival calls “the world’s largest free pop-up literary event,” more than 500 writers will crowd venues throughout the neighborhood.

Just a few of the events: “Noir at the Bar With Mystery Writers of America” (Amnesia, 853 Valencia St., 6:30-7:30 p.m.), “Dirty Old Women: Erotica by Older Women” (Good Vibrations, 603 Valencia St., 5-6 p.m.) and The Chronicle’s Roast of the Little Man by the newspaper’s Datebook staffers (The Chapel, 777 Valencia St., 6:30-7:30 p.m.).

The day will begin with a first-ever Lit Crawl Book Fair, outside the Chapel, from 12:30 to 4 p.m. Among the small presses, magazines and businesses that will be present are the Green Arcade, Left Margin Lit, McSweeney’s, Transit Books and Zyzzyva.

Lit Crawl: 5-9 p.m. Saturday, Oct. 20. The Mission, S.F. litquake.org
