Performance legend Shelton Mann premieres new work in SF|http://www.sfgate.com|https://datebook.sfchronicle.com/dance/performance-legend-shelton-mann-premieres-new-work-in-sf||2018-10-09|Claudia Bauer,Chronicle Staff Report,Jesse Hamlin,Steven Winn||Sara Shelton Mann keeps a relatively low profile, but when she emerges with a new performance, she can’t be missed.

Shelton Mann’s latest work, “Echo/Riding the Rapids,” is an investigation into sound that she plans to perform in alongside co-creators Anya Cloud, Jesse Hewit and Jesse Zaritt. Electronic composer Pamela Z will play an original score that blends live and recorded sound.

Iterations of “Echo” have toured to Berlin and Boston, but this hometown version set for Thursday-Saturday, Oct. 11-13, is considered a world premiere.

Shelton Mann’s influences range from teachers like Merce Cunningham, Alwin Nikolai and Erik Hawkins to spiritual practices like qigong and dowsing. The 2000 Guggenheim Fellow has spent five decades teaching, dancing and creating work that is inimitably her own, and her collective Contraband revamped modern interdisciplinary performance and amplified the voices of artists like Jess Curtis, Rinde Eckert and Keith Hennessy.

There’s no guessing what she’ll do, so show up with an open mind and let the performance immerse you.

Sara Shelton Mann: 8 p.m. Thursday-Saturday, Oct. 11-13. $30. ODC Theater, 3153 17th St., S.F. 415-863-9834. www.odc.dance
