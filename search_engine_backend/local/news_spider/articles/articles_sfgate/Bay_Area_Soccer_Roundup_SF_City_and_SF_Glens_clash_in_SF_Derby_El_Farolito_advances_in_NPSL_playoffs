Bay Area Soccer Roundup: SF City and SF Glens clash in SF Derby, El Farolito advances in NPSL playoffs|http://www.sfgate.com/quakes|https://blog.sfgate.com/soccer/2018/07/12/bay-area-soccer-roundup-sf-derby-sf-city-and-sf-glens-clash-el-farolito-advances-in-npsl-playoffs/||2018-07-12|Douglas Zimmerman||The second round of the SF Derby will take place Thursday evening at Kezar Stadium when SF City FC will host their crosstown rivals SF Glens at 7 pm.

The game will be mostly about local bragging rights for both teams. SF City won the first derby matchup last month at Boxer. The Glens and SF City have had subpar seasons with City winning 4 out of 12 games and the Glens only 3 out of 12 games. The two teams currently occupy the bottom two spots of the USL PDL Southwest Division and are eliminated from making the PDL playoffs.

The match is the last home game for SF City and the first 100 fans in attendance will receive a free water bottle.

El Farolito advance in NPSL Playoffs

After a strong first season in the NPSL, San Francisco’s El Farolito advanced in the NPSL Western Conference Playoffs after defeating the Sonoma County Sol 2-0.

The win advances El Farolito to a semifinal home match this Saturday, July 14th against FCM Portland at 11:30 am at Boxer Stadium.

If the SF team wins, they will host the championship match of the NPSL Western Conference versus FC Golden State or Orange County FC.

FC Golden State beat the other Bay Area team in the playoffs, Oakland’s CD Aguiluchos USA, last weekend 4-2.
