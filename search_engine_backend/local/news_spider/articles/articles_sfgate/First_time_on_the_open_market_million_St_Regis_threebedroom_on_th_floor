Well before the St. Regis Residences at 188 Minna was even under construction, the owners of Unit 38A had already bought in. They had long lived in single-family homes in Pacific Heights and Presidio Heights, but had reached a point in their lives when it became time to downsize, according to their agent Gregg Lynn.

The only problem was they didn’t want to downsize too much, Lynn said, and almost all of the floor plans for the full-service building called for 1,600-to-1,700-square-foot units. Only three units were available with a 3,200-square-foot plan. The owners swiftly bought the unit on the highest of the three floors and then started their multi-year wait.

In the meantime, they hired their long-time interior designer to customize the unit with automated features like flat-screen televisions that pop out of cabinets and remote-controlled window coverings throughout the home, which has city views to the north and bay and bridge views to the east. They also put in gorgeous Versailles-style hardwood floors, a marble master bath and custom walk-in closets.

In the winter of 2006, they moved into “the largest and highest simplex in the building,” according to Lynn. The agent says the word “simplex” (the term means a one-floor home, and is a riff on the two-floor duplex or three-floor triplex) is his “dog whistle to people who have lived in vertical homes for 30 years and want to start thinking about simplifying. Simplex. Simplify.”

He said that about half of the prospective buyers who have to come to look at the $10.9-million property fit that category. “They can let go of the housekeeper, and the gardener and the painter,” he explained. “Everything is going to be taken care of by the HOA.” The monthly fees, which include a fitness center and gym, as well as access to the spa, 24-hour room service and other St. Regis amenities, is about $3,000.

The other pool of buyers already own in the building and are looking for the rare chance to upsize into a larger unit. “I would not be be surprised if the eventual buyer is already a St. Regis owner,” said Lynn, who added that about ten buyers have toured the property since it came to market September 13.

Even rarer than the square footage is the bay-facing small terrace balcony off the main living space, one of only a handful in a downtown condo high rise. “I love that walk-out balcony,” Lynn said. “It’s one of the most unique spots in all of downtown San Francisco.”
