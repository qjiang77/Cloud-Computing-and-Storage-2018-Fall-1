A few years back, we told you about the remarkable full-floor penthouse created, but never lived in, by a wealthy heiress back when the Art Deco Hamilton building was converted from a hotel to condos in the 1960s.

At the time, the Tenderloin penthouse with 360-degree views, a terrace fountain and a solarium with 21-foot arched glass ceilings was trying to fetch a price of $3.95 million. The twenty-first floor unit was removed from market without a sale, but has now returned asking the exact same price.

According to agent Joel Goodrich, who is co-listing the property with Mark Levinson, the neighborhood has changed a lot since he last sold the property to the current owner in 2000 for $2.5 million. “Since then, the neighborhood has started to improve and there are signs that may accelerate,” he says. “Because of its strategic location in between the Van Ness corridor with its new $2-billion hospital and multiple new developments, the popular shopping, dining and entertainment attractions of Union Square and the Theater District, as well as all the tech companies of mid-Market (Twitter, ZenDesk, Microsoft, etc.) and SOMA (Salesforce, Amazon, Google, Facebook, etc.) the next decade should bring some very positive changes.”

He added that if the nearly 3,600-square-foot property were located in Nob Hill, Russian Hill or Pacific Heights, he would list it in the $10-million to $15-million range.

The owner has tried to sell the property several times over the last few years because, Goodrich says, he spends most of his time on the East Coast. He does live in the property when he’s in town, though, and during his tenure the kitchen has been updated with stainless steel appliances, glass tile backsplash and granite counters.

A laundry room and powder room have also been refreshed, but otherwise many of the three-bedroom’s design details remain intact. This includes three Italian marble bathrooms; parquet de Versailles flooring; 30 Corinthian columns; two marble fireplaces (one wood-burning, one gas); hand-painted mural walls and cast bronze exterior doors. There’s also antique French hand-carved doors between the private keyed elevator entry foyer and the rest of the home.

Goodrich says the listing is “getting some good traction” this time around, including over 4,800 “likes” on his Instagram account. Among those interested in the property are a real-estate developer and a “tech personality,” he says.
