With North Bay fires still burning, we can’t yet know the exact number of people looking for shelter. Reportedly, an estimated 333-square-miles have burned, which means–for perspective–California’s scorched area is larger than New York City.

Counting the now homeless is complicated. According to the Mercury News, “together, the Tubbs, Pocket, Sonoma, Nuns and Atlas fires destroyed a total of 5,017 structures, though officials have yet to identify how many of those were single family homes, apartments or condos, meaning the full extent of lost housing has yet to be determined.”

Stories of doubled and even tripled rent are particularly distressing in an area that even in the best of times commands high rents and low inventory. In the wake of such a catastrophe, with an estimated $65 Billion worth of real estate at risk of destruction or already destroyed, the demand for housing is in itself a whole separate emergency.

Hope on the horizon

Instead of gauging, some agencies and individuals with housing to offer are actually offering special deals to fire victims. In San Rafael, for instance, a two-bedroom renting for $2595 grants the first month free to fire victims. In other areas, waiving of application fees, free pet rent for four-six months, and similar deals are on offer.

Parc Marin, a Corte Madera complex, posted on Craigslist that they “are looking to help fire victims who have lost their homes”: Homes that are “completely renovated, [in a] park-like community in Corte Madera on 3.5 acres.” The offerings to fire victims included:

*$99 Security Deposit (on approved credit)

*Waive Application Fees

*Free First Month’s Rent

*Four Months of Free Pet Rent

*500 Visa Gift Card to help purchase household items

Further afield

Aware of the housing crunch, short term listings in places like Pittsburgh and Orinda are advertising homes for fire victims only.

The Reliant Property Group, with properties in Antioch, Sacramento, Vallejo, and American Canyon told On the Block that they are offering 50 homes to displaced North Bay residents. These homes come with special offers such as no application fee, reduced deposits and special lease terms.

Community support

Failing a rental of one’s own, community housing share programs are another alternative. NBC News writes that AirBnB has started Open Homeshere to link available shelter to those who need it most.

In addition, “tech workers in San Francisco also started a Google Doc to connect evacuees with housing assistance. If you have space in your home and would welcome evacuees, you’re invited to add your name to the list.”

Meanwhile, SHARE Sonoma County is arranging emergency home shares for displaced residents of Sonoma County. “Those willing to host a person or family for anywhere from days to months should contact PPSC SHARE Sonoma County at SHAREfire@petalumapeople.org.”
