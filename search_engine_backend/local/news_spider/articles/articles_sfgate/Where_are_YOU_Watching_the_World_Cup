Where are YOU Watching the World Cup?|http://www.sfgate.com/quakes|https://blog.sfgate.com/soccer/2018/06/13/where-are-you-watching-fifa-2018-world-cup-bay-area-san-francisco/||2018-06-13|Charles Wollin||Well then. We’re almost there after nearly 4 years of waiting! Teams are getting set, ready, GO. Planes, swanky outfits are descending on Russian tarmacs, final training sessions are taking place, but the big event starts tomorrow.

With scattered early game times, do you find yourself asking your colleague, family or teammate, “Where are you watching the World Cup?”

San Francisco is fit with a ton of amazing pubs, bars, cafes and restaurants to watch the big showpiece. As I’ve mentioned before, we have a solid foundation and amazing community here. That’s why I’ll be going on a tour of sorts through SF for as many matches as I can.

It’s important to diversify. Whether you’re supporting favorites, (Germany, France and Brazil) Golden generationals (Belgium), Messi-dona (Argentina), Salah (Egypt), minnows (Panama), host nation (Russia), follow the best kit in the tournament (Nigeria) or fancy some teams starving for success (Mexico or England) there’s always a spot for everyone.

So grab a friend, breakfast, beer, and get your Instagram story or Tweet ready and let’s get on with it! Below is Week 1’s schedule (fit with my 9-5 schedule in tow as well). Hope to see you at a few matches!
