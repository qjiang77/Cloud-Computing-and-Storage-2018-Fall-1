The San Francisco Hard Rock delivers on this promise, and while it may not be for everyone, it’s certainly a fun attraction for families and other tourists taking in the sights at Fisherman’s Wharf. Visitors can take a boat ride through the bay to the Golden Gate Bridge and then stop in at Hard Rock Cafe San Francisco for some local music history and a burger before heading off to souvenir shops and museums in the area. Here’s what makes the San Francisco cafe worth the visit.

Live Music

The “hard rock” isn’t just part of the name at the <a href=" // events.sfgate.com/ event/ hard-rock-rising-local-battle-of-the-bands-competition591b8c18df5cf" Rock Cafe San Francisco. Diners can catch live music acts both inside the restaurant and out, with special events often leading to multi-band shows. Comedy and other live performances are also often on the menu.

Local Music Memorabilia

Music memorabilia is a major part of any Hard Rock Cafe’s decor, and, given San Francisco’s history with music, there are a lot of local artifacts to explore. The hippie rock scene of the 1960s and ’70s is of particular interest, and the cafe has a few relevant items in its permanent collection, including clothing from Janis Joplin and sheet music written by Jerry Garcia. Other items from artists without any formal connection to San Francisco, like Beyoncé and KISS, are also on display to round out the decor and make the cafe more relevant for all visitors.

Contests and Special Exhibits

Some of the San Francisco Hard Rock’s local music events focus on contests, such as battle of the bands showcases for local bands and amateur singing contests that let diners provide the entertainment. One event, the <a href=" // insidescoopsf.sfgate.com/ blog/ 2015/ 04/ 13/ the-good-news-is-that-you-can-sing-for-free-food-at-san-franciscos-hard-rock-cafe-this-week/ " for Your Supper sing-off, allows guests to get onstage and croon for a free burger. Those who aren't exactly thrilled to perform in front of a crowd can also enjoy special exhibitions of art and mementoes from local music heroes like the Grateful Dead.

Recognizable Food

Menus at the Hard Rock Cafe are fairly consistent, though some local specials may be available from time to time. The San Francisco Hard Rock usually offers its Fisherman’s Wharf clam chowder in a bread bowl made by the local Boudin Bakery. For the most part, diners can expect crowd-pleasing classics like nachos, burgers and mac and cheese, and a special kid’s menu with staples like chicken tenders and pizza. Families with picky eaters will be relieved to find such an unchallenging menu in a city notorious for its avant-garde cuisine.

Prime Tourist Location

Thanks to its central location at Pier 39 on Fisherman’s Wharf, the <a href=" // blog.sfgate.com/ culture/ 2012/ 08/ 27/ tourist-trapped-hard-rock-cafe/ " Rock Cafe San Francisco is easy to find and simple to get to using public transportation. The Hard Rock got a makeover in 2017, and is a fresh and modern space to relax after a long day of sightseeing.
