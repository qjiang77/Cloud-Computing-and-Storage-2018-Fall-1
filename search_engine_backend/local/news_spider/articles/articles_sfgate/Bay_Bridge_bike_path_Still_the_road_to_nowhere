Bay Bridge bike path: Still the road to nowhere|http://blog.sfgate.com|http://blog.sfgate.com/matierandross/2016/08/23/bay-bridge-bike-path-still-the-road-to-nowhere/||2016-08-23|Andy Ross||Already two years behind schedule, the opening of the Bay Bridge eastern span bike path connector to Yerba Buena Island is being delayed another month, until mid-October — this time because the landing area is still a mess.

As recently as three months ago, Caltrans officials said they expected to finally connect the 2.2-mile path from Oakland by September. On Monday, however, a Bay Bridge oversight panel decided construction crews needed more time to grade, pave and stripe the road where the bike path will touch down.

Crews are also building a parking lot on Yerba Buena for bicyclists who choose to park their cars on the island and peddle east across the span.

The path originally was supposed to be completed in fall 2014, a year after the eastern span opened to cars. But some work couldn’t be started until demolition workers took down the old eastern span, and subsequent questions about the safety rail, the path’s observation platform and even winter rains have been blamed for the sluggish construction of the final leg.
