Amy Tan, Armistead Maupin meet onstage for Litquake|http://www.sfgate.com/books|https://datebook.sfchronicle.com/books/amy-tan-armistead-maupin-meet-onstage-for-litquake||2018-10-17|Ryan Kost,J.C. Hallman,David Roderick,John Mcmurtrie,Chronicle Staff Report,Brandon Yu||Amy Tan and Armistead Maupin, two of San Francisco’s literary greats, are sharing the stage at a Litquake event this year. The pairing might seem a little odd at first, but the two are old friends and both have written books that brought representation to and changed the popular discourse about communities that are frequently pushed to the margins.

Tan, of course, is the bestselling author of “Joy Luck Club” and Maupin wrote the series “Tales of the City,” which still serves as an introduction to San Francisco for many.

No doubt much of the discussion will revolve around their memoirs. Tan recently published “Where the Past Begins,” which works both as a book that examines her past and something of a writer’s guide.

Maupin’s memoir, “Logical Family,” recently came out in paperback. A few years ago, he told The Chronicle, his editors had been pushing him to write the book; it was finally released last October.

Amy Tan and Armistead Maupin: 6 p.m. Friday, Oct. 19. $15-$20. Swedish American Hall, 2174 Market St., S.F. www.litquake.org
