Treasure Island Music Festival: A guide to the boutique indie festival on the bay|http://www.sfgate.com/performance|https://datebook.sfchronicle.com/guide/treasure-island-music-festival-a-guide-to-the-boutique-indie-festival-on-the-bay||2018-10-09|Aidin Vaziri,Chronicle Staff,Mariecar Mendoza,Andrew Gilbert||What is Treasure Island Music Festival?

There are several reasons why the Treasure Island Music Festival has stood as the Bay Area’s favorite boutique festival for the past decade: The unforgettable sets by indie stars like Beck, the National, Massive Attack, Death Cab for Cutie, Outkast, Vampire Weekend, LCD Soundsystem, Best Coast and more. The continuous music from more than two dozen acts playing on a pair of adjacent stages with no overlapping sets. The laid-back atmosphere of a backyard barbecue with a dazzling array of midway attractions, art installations, food trucks, a silent disco and the 60-foot Ferris wheel that lifts fans above the fog and howling gusts of wind.

But after 10 years on its namesake location, the festival — co-produced by a pair of powerhouse Bay Area promoters, Noise Pop Industries and Another Planet Entertainment — was forced to relocate in 2016 to make way for construction on Treasure Island’s long-awaited $6 billion redevelopment project. Taking a one-year hiatus to secure a new location, the promoters will bring the two-day outdoor concert back to the bay on Saturday-Sunday, Oct. 13-14 at Middle Harbor Shoreline Park in Oakland.

Who’s playing?

Tame Impala and A$AP Rocky will headline the festival on Saturday and Sunday, respectively, topping a bill that also includes Silk City (the new project by producers Diplo and Mark Ronson), Lord Huron, Pusha T, Santigold, Courtney Barnett, Jungle, Soccer Mommy , Sharon Van Etten, Aminé, Cigarettes After Sex, Hiatus Kaiyote and others.

There are only two stages — the City and the Town — so it won’t be hard to catch ’em all. Here’s the daily lineup:
