Any way you slice it, it’s a good idea.

Chance the Rapper’s SocialWorks youth empowerment charity and Connie’s Pizza, 2373 S. Archer, have partnered for a good cause. Beginning Oct. 8, the Chicago pizzamaker will donate 55 percent of proceeds from the special “Take a Chance” pizza to SocialWorks . Patrons are also being asked to round up checks to benefit the charity.

The pizza, in the shape of the No. “3” (naturally), was designed by Chance. The cost: $24.99 per pizza.

To kick off the initiative, Chance will make a special appearance from 3 to 7 p.m. Oct. 6 at the Archer Avenue location. DJ Oreo will also be on-hand for the invitation-only festivities.
