More than 50 arrested at McDonald's HQ in Chicago as week of protests continues|http://www.cnbc.com/abigail-hess|http://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/05/more-than-50-protesters-arrested-at-mcdonalds-headquarters-in-chicago.html||2018-10-05|Abigail Hess,Courtesy Of Fight For||Among those arrested on Thursday in Chicago were striking fast-food workers, Illinois Rep. Jan Schakowsky and Service Employees International Union (SEIU) President Mary Kay Henry. The Chicago Police told the Chicago Sun-Times that 52 people were arrested for trespassing on private property, while the organizing group coordinating the event, Fight for $15, says that 54 were arrested.

Fight for $15 estimates that roughly 1,000 protesters were present, though these numbers are unconfirmed.

&quot;Some politicians will do whatever it takes to block workers from coming together in a union. That&#39;s unacceptable, and it&#39;s a big reason why paychecks across the country are flat while corporate profits are fatter than ever,&quot; said Schakowsky, in a statement shared with CNBC Make It. &quot;I&#39;m proud to support workers in the fight for $15 who are striking and protesting all across the country today for union rights. Unions are the solution to un-rigging the economy and strengthening communities here in Illinois and nationwide.&quot;

Adriana Alvarez, a McDonald&#39;s employee from Cicero, Illinois, walked out of work in order to attend the protest.

&quot;We&#39;re on strike today to demand the union that fast-food workers need. We need unions for all low wage and service sector workers,&quot; she said in a statement shared with CNBC by the Fight for $15. &quot;And I have a message for any politicians listening: Stand with us in our fight for union rights, don&#39;t back these corporations. Because on election day, we&#39;re showing up to the polls and casting our votes for elect leaders who support working people in Illinois.&quot;

In response to the protest, a McDonald&#39;s spokesperson sent the following statement, adding that roughly 95 percent of McDonald&#39;s locations are franchises. (Many states have laws protecting parent companies from grievances aimed at franchises.)

&quot;Our commitment to the communities we serve includes providing opportunities for restaurant employees to succeed at McDonald&#39;s and beyond with world-class training and education programs to help them build the skills needed for today&#39;s workforce. This year alone, we have tripled tuition assistance for restaurant employees by allocating $150 million over five years to our Archways to Opportunity education program to provide upfront college tuition assistance, earn a high school diploma, and access free education advising services. These benefits show McDonald&#39;s and its independent franchisees&#39; commitment to providing jobs that fit around the lives of restaurant employees so they may pursue their education and career ambitions.&quot;

The events follow Tuesday&#39;s news that Amazon will be raising its minimum wage to $15 an hour. &quot;We listened to our critics, thought hard about what we wanted to do, and decided we want to lead,&quot; said Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos said in a statement. &quot;We&#39;re excited about this change and encourage our competitors and other large employers to join us.&quot;
