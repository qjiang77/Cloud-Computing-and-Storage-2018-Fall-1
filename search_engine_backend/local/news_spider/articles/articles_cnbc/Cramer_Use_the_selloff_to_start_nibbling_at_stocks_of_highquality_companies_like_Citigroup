Cramer: Use the sell-off to start 'nibbling' at stocks of high-quality companies like Citigroup|http://www.cnbc.com/mad-money|http://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/18/cramer-use-sell-off-to-nibble-at-stocks-of-high-quality-companies.html||2018-10-18|Elizabeth Gurdus||Sell-offs that occur during earnings season often provide great opportunities for investors to build positions in top-notch stocks, CNBC&#39;s Jim Cramer argued Thursday as the market compounded its monthly losses.

&quot;In a sell-off during earnings season, you can&#39;t have a lot of guesswork. You want to be sure you&#39;re buying companies that you absolutely know are doing well,&quot; the &quot;Mad Money&quot; host said. &quot;That&#39;s what&#39;s so great about sell-offs in the reporting period: you&#39;ve got the perfect shopping list because the companies have just told you exactly how they&#39;re doing.&quot;

And while the sell-off might not be over yet, as Cramer&#39;s colleague and technician Mark Sebastian predicted on Tuesday, Cramer spotted some stellar buying opportunities in the widespread weakness.

&quot;I think these are levels, if you have a lot of cash, where you can pick a stock and start nibbling,&quot; he said. &quot;You want a high-quality situation at a discount, where you know the merchandise isn&#39;t damaged, just the stock.&quot;

Right now, four stocks fit the bill, Cramer said: United Continental, Citigroup, UnitedHealth Group and PepsiCo.

United Continental reported very strong third-quarter results on Wednesday, with higher travel demand offsetting higher fuel costs. The United Airlines parent posted profit growth of nearly 30 percent for the quarter and raised its full-year outlook.

Calling the beat-and-raise report a &quot;remarkable feat,&quot; Cramer noted that shares of the airline giant were falling on Wednesday &quot;even as oil, [the] principal cost for the airlines, has sold off hard and it seems to have difficulty stabilizing here.&quot;

&quot;United Continental&#39;s cheap. It&#39;s doing amazingly well, unless something&#39;s changed since earlier in the week,&quot; he continued. &quot;Trust me, it didn&#39;t.&quot;

Citigroup delivered what the &quot;Mad Money&quot; host saw as &quot;the best of the bank quarters that we&#39;ve seen&quot; last Friday, beating Wall Street&#39;s earnings expectations as the business began to reflect cost cuts from changes within the company and lower corporate taxes.

&quot;If you&#39;re worried about the Fed being too aggressive here, please recall that about half of Citi&#39;s book of business is from overseas,&quot; Cramer said.

&quot;If you&#39;re selling this stock, the odds are you&#39;re selling some of your shares to the company itself, as Citi&#39;s got a colossal buyback,&quot; he added. &quot;The company&#39;s trying to repurchase about 7 percent of its shares outstanding each year. I think it&#39;s a mistake to make it easy for them.&quot;

UnitedHealth Group posted &quot;a classic beat and raise, one of the most amazing ones [Cramer&#39;s] seen&quot; on Tuesday, he said, adding that its medical loss ratio — a key barometer for health insurers — was &quot;just extraordinary.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not used to being able to pick up the stock of a company that gave you a blockbuster set of numbers at such a discount,&quot; the &quot;Mad Money&quot; host said. &quot;But UNH is part of the stock market so, yes, it is coming down, too.&quot;

Last but not least, PepsiCo&#39;s earnings report in early October, delivered on departed CEO Indra Nooyi&#39;s last day in her role, topped Wall Street&#39;s earnings estimates and showed higher consumer demand for some of its key brands.

&quot;As usual, there were the problems ... with the transportation, with the raw costs, ... but they weren&#39;t nearly as boiler-plate bad as other companies that we&#39;ve heard from since then,&quot; Cramer said. &quot;The buyback is real, the dividend, at 3.4 percent, is strong, and the management change, with Indra Nooyi passing the baton to Ramon Laguarta, has been smooth.&quot;

So while investors might be panicking at the sea of red washing over their screens, stock-trackers or portfolios, Cramer made the case for keeping an even keel and not letting the market&#39;s volatility shake their conviction.

&quot;Stick with companies that just reported monster good numbers and you rarely go wrong, even in this kind of incredibly negative pin action,&quot; he concluded.
