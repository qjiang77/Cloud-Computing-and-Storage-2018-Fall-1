Cramer's lightning round: 'I can't countenance' selling BlackRock's stock this low|http://www.cnbc.com/mad-money|http://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/16/cramers-lightning-round-i-cant-countenance-selling-blackrock-here.html||2018-10-16|Elizabeth Gurdus||BlackRock Inc.: &quot;The stock got hit today, down $18. It&#39;s at the 52-week low. It&#39;s got some of the best people on earth working there. I am certainly not going to countenance selling [CEO] Larry Fink&#39;s stock at a 3 percent yield, so I say hold on.&quot;

Kratos Defense & Security Solutions Inc.: &quot;No. This stock is up too much. We got a nice hit in this one and we are moving onto the next, so let&#39;s not do that. If you want a defense stock, I prefer Raytheon, which we tell club members is very good.&quot;

Energy Transfer Partners LP: &quot;It yields 10 [percent], I know. They&#39;re doing a lot of things to make the structure better. It is still too risky for me, but I understand why people would want to be attracted to it. That&#39;s all I have to say about it.&quot;

JetBlue Airways Corp.: &quot;You know what? I like United Continental, even up 5 [percent], and I have chosen not to really push any other of the airlines until I get better data. I like United Continental and then I would go with American, then I would go with Delta and then I would go with JetBlue, and not before then. It&#39;s too dicey for me.&quot;

TherapeuticsMD: &quot;TXMD&#39;s a little too speculative for this guy. This is the one with products for women. We&#39;ve had them on a bunch of times. It&#39;s been at $5 for too long. I say go high quality here and that&#39;s not one of them. It&#39;s OK, but it&#39;s not high-quality enough.&quot;
