Saudi Arabian Foreign Minister apologizes for Khashoggi's death as calls grow for more answers|http://www.cnbc.com|http://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/21/trump-europe-call-saudi-account-of-khashoggi-death-incomplete.html||2018-10-21|Umar Farooq,Anadolu Agency,Getty Images||Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said on Sunday the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul was a &quot;huge and grave mistake&quot; and promised his family that those responsible will be punished.

&quot;This is a terrible mistake. This is a terrible tragedy. Our condolences go out to them. We feel their pain,&quot; Jubeir said in an interview with Fox News. &quot;Unfortunately, a huge and grave mistake was made and I assure them that those responsible will be held accountable for this.&quot;

He called the journalist&#39;s killing a &quot;rogue operation&quot; and an &quot;aberration,&quot; and that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was neither involved nor aware.

Jubeir&#39;s message came as President Donald Trump joined European leaders on Saturday in pushing Saudi Arabia for more answers about Jamal Khashoggi after Riyadh changed its story and acknowledged that the journalist died over two weeks ago at its consulate in Istanbul.

Saudi Arabia said early on Saturday that Khashoggi, a critic of the country&#39;s de facto ruler, bin Salman, had died in a fight inside the building.

Germany called that explanation &quot;inadequate&quot; and questioned whether countries should sell arms to Saudi Arabia, while France and the European Union urged an in-depth investigation to find out what happened to the Washington Post columnist after he entered the consulate on Oct. 2 for documents for his marriage.

Turkish officials suspect Khashoggi, a Saudi national and U.S. resident, was killed inside the consulate by a team of Saudi agents and his body cut up.

The Khashoggi case has caused an international outrage and frayed political and business ties between Western powers and U.S. ally Saudi Arabia, the world&#39;s No.1 oil exporter.

Asked during a trip to Nevada if he was satisfied that Saudi officials had been fired over Khashoggi&#39;s death, Trump said: &quot;No, I am not satisfied until we find the answer. But it was a big first step, it was a good first step. But I want to get to the answer.&quot;

Trump&#39;s comments about the Khashoggi incident in recent days have ranged from threatening Saudi Arabia with &quot;very severe&quot; consequences and warning of economic sanctions, to more conciliatory remarks in which he has played up the country&#39;s role as a U.S. ally against Iran and Islamist militants, as well as a major purchaser of U.S. arms.

He had earlier called the Saudi narrative of what happened to Khashoggi credible.

Riyadh provided no evidence on Saturday to support its account and made no mention of what had become of Khashoggi&#39;s body.

French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian called for a full investigation and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, in a joint statement with her foreign minister, said the Saudi account was not enough.

&quot;We expect transparency from Saudi Arabia about the circumstances of his death ... The information available about events in the Istanbul consulate is inadequate,&quot; the Germans said.

Trump said it was possible that Prince Mohammed had been unaware of the circumstances around the death of Khashoggi, 59. Trump said he would speak with the prince.

For Western allies, a main question in the Khashoggi affair will be whether they believe that the prince, who has painted himself as a reformer, has any culpability. King Salman, 82, had handed the day-to-day running of Saudi Arabia to him.

Trump, who has forged close ties with Saudi Arabia and the crown prince, said he was concerned that it was unclear where the journalist&#39;s body is.

Turkish investigators are likely to find out what happened to the body &quot;before long&quot;, a senior Turkish official said earlier on Saturday.

Officials told Reuters in Turkey on Thursday that Khashoggi&#39;s remains may have been dumped in Belgrad Forest adjacent to Istanbul, and at a rural location near the city of Yalova, 90 km (55 miles) south of Istanbul.

Turkish sources say the authorities have an audio recording purportedly documenting Khashoggi&#39;s murder inside the consulate. Pro-government Turkish newspaper Yeni Safak, citing the audio, said his torturers cut off his fingers during an interrogation and later beheaded him.

Trump said no one from his administration has seen video or a transcript of what happened inside the consulate.

A group of 15 Saudi nationals arrived in Istanbul in two planes and entered the consulate on the same day Khashoggi was there and later left the country, a Turkish security source told Reuters.
