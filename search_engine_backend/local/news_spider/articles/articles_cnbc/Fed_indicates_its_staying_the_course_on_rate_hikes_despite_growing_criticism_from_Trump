Fed indicates it's staying the course on rate hikes despite growing criticism from Trump|http://www.cnbc.com/economy|http://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/17/fed-points-to-more-rate-hikes-amid-criticism-from-trump.html||2018-10-17|Jeff Cox,Andrew Harrer,Bloomberg,Getty Images||Federal Reserve officials remain convinced that continuing to gradually increase interest rates is the best formula to preserve a steady economy, according to minutes released Wednesday of the central bank&#39;s most recent policy meeting.

That may not please President Donald Trump, who has been vocal in his criticism of the central bank&#39;s actions.

A summary of the Sept. 25-26 Federal Open Market Committee session reflected both confidence in the rate of economic growth and some hesitancy over the impact that tariffs might have on the future path.

Ultimately, the committee unanimously voted to approve a quarter-point hike to its benchmark rate target, with members indicating that more increases are on the way. The increase took the Fed&#39;s overnight target to a range of 2 percent to 2.25 percent.

&quot;With regard to the outlook for monetary policy beyond this meeting, participants generally anticipated that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would most likely be consistent with a sustained economic expansion, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near 2 percent over the medium term,&quot; the minutes read.
