Italy's budget crisis threatens the entire EU project, strategist says|http://www.cnbc.com/world|http://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/19/italy-budget-threatens-the-entire-eu-project-strategist-says.html||2018-10-19|Silvia Amaro||Not confident Italy budget solution will be found soon, analyst says 3:50 AM ET Fri, 19 Oct 2018 | 02:28

The European Union needs to be &quot;sensible&quot; in how it deals with the Italian budget crisis or the entire project could come to an end, one strategist told CNBC Friday morning.

The ongoing confrontation between the anti-establishment government in Italy and the European Commission has intensified over the few last weeks, with Rome insisting on increasing its spending next year, despite the EU&#39;s disapproval. The concern in Brussels is that the higher spending will increase Italy&#39;s debt pile, which is already the second largest in the euro zone.

&quot;I think it is important the European Union give them some leeway and allow them to have some kind of deficit,&quot; Bryn Jones, head of fixed income at Rathbones, told CNBC on Friday morning.

&quot;I think the Italians are actually in a very strong negotiation position. If they (the EU) don&#39;t want to jettison Italy from Europe, the whole project dies. They have to be quite sensible,&quot; Jones said on &quot;Squawk Box Europe.&quot;

On Thursday, the Brussels-based institution sent a letter to the Italian finance minister, Giovanni Tria, warning him that the 2019 budget draft seemed to point to a &quot;particularly serious non-compliance with the budgetary policy obligations laid down&quot; in European rules.

The Italian government has until Monday to reply to the commission&#39;s latest letter. If from that response, the commission still believes that the budget is in serious non-compliance, it has two weeks to adopt an opinion and request a new draft budget within three weeks.
