How Goldman Sachs is changing its culture to win more deals|http://www.cnbc.com/editors-picks|http://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/08/the-new-goldman-sachs-hungry-humbled-and-moving-to-a-neighborhood-near-you.html||2018-10-08|Hugh Son,Source,David Eisman||The banker moves are an effort by Goldman to drum up another $500 million in revenue by 2020. It's a key component of a bigger plan by Chief Executive Officer David Solomon to boost revenue by $5 billion by broadening its banking and trading client base, finding growth in smaller markets and pushing into retail products like personal loans. Solomon's main challenge is to improve results that have been stung by a multiyear downturn in trading revenue.

The new strategy puts it in direct competition with J.P. Morgan, which decided in 2012 to place investment bankers in regional offices to pitch commercial banking clients. Dimon's gambit worked: J.P. Morgan boosted investment-banking fees for the segment to $2.3 billion from $800 million. They hope to reach $3 billion in revenue within 3 years.

Goldman has from six to 15 bankers in each of these new offices, according to Matt Gibson, co-head of the bank's global investment banking services. While the firm already had outposts in San Francisco, Houston and Chicago, the vast majority of bankers work from the firm's New York headquarters.

"There's that much more trust that your interests are aligned because you don't want to screw it up if you're going to have to answer to someone who's effectively a neighbor," Eisman said. "There's a level of comfort that you're going to be accountable and have their side of the equation. It only increases the closer you are in proximity and the more time you spend together."

Goldman figures that if it can embed its people into communities where executives and board members live, they can win more business with big corporations they already cover and smaller public and private companies that the bank has historically ignored.
