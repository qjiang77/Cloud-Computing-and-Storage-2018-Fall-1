Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told CNBC on Thursday the United States currently has the tightest labor market he&#39;s ever seen.

Greenspan, 92, suggested the nearly 50-year low unemployment rate coupled with American corporations clamoring for workers will force up wages and inflation. &quot;Ultimately prices take hold,&quot; he said.

&quot;This is the tightest market, labor market, I&#39;ve ever seen, he said in an interview with &quot;Squawk Box.&quot; &quot;But concurrently, we have a very slow productivity increase.&quot;

Greenspan — who served as chairman of the Fed from 1987 to 2006, spanning four presidents — said that&#39;s having a significant impact on GDP growth.

&quot;And, therefore, it&#39;s ultimately the source of populism, which has infected the United States,&quot; he added.

President Donald Trump has repeatedly slammed Fed Chairman Jerome Powell in recent weeks, saying the Fed is increasing rates too quickly and that stronger economic growth won&#39;t lead to problematic inflation.

In the CNBC interview, Greenspan gave Powell a vote of confidence, saying he&#39;s not worried about where the Powell-led Fed is headed with monetary policy. Greenspan added the best way for central bankers to deal with presidential jawboning, which happens during all administrations, is to put on &quot;earmuffs.&quot;

According to minutes released of the Fed&#39;s most recent policy meeting, central bank officials remain convinced that continuing to gradually increase interest rates is the best formula to preserve a steady economy.

Greenspan&#39;s new book, &quot;Capitalism In America: A History,&quot; which he co-authored with Economist political editor Adrian Wooldridge, was released this week.
