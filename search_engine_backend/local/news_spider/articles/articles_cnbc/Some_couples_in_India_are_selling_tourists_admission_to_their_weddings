Some couples in India are selling tourists admission to their weddings|http://www.cnbc.com/world|http://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/16/indian-weddings-tourists-buy-tickets-to-experience-nuptials.html||2018-10-16|Saheli Roy Choudhury,Source,Carly Stevens,Tim Gower,Navaneeth,Moment,Getty Images||When Surabhi Chauhan, a Delhi-based fund manager, got married last November, roughly 400 guests attended her wedding.

Two names on the guest list were people she had never met before: Carly Stevens and Tim Gower.

The Australian travel bloggers paid around $200 for a two-day invitation to attend Chauhan&#39;s wedding through a start-up called Join My Wedding.

&quot;The concept was pretty new,&quot; Chauhan told CNBC in an interview, explaining that she came across the start-up while booking her wedding venue. &quot;We were also getting to know people from other countries. We were very much excited and open about it, given the fact that it was new.&quot;

She and her husband were introduced to Stevens and Gower by one of the start-up&#39;s co-founders, Orsi Parkanyi, she said.

&quot;We were chatting and coordinating, we had a brief introduction about each of us, what exactly we do, our respective profiles (and) what are the arrangements that will be there, the kind of attire they&#39;re supposed to wear â€” all those conversations happened,&quot; Chauhan said.
