US intelligence officials are concerned about voter-influence efforts from Russia, China, and Iran|http://www.cnbc.com|http://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/19/us-worried-by-voter-influence-efforts-of-russia-china-iran.html||2018-10-19|Al Drago,Bloomberg,Getty Images||U.S. intelligence officials say they&#39;re concerned about &quot;ongoing campaigns&quot; by Russia, China, Iran and other countries to undermine confidence in American democracy.

In a joint statement, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the Homeland Security Department, the Justice Department and the FBI say they&#39;re worried about activities that &quot;seek to influence voter perceptions and decision-making&quot; in the 2018 and 2020 elections.

The agencies say the &quot;ongoing campaigns&quot; could take many forms. Examples include attempts to influence voters through social media, sponsoring content in English language media such as the Russian outlet RT, or &quot;seeding disinformation through sympathetic spokespersons regarding political candidates and disseminating foreign propaganda.&quot;

Intelligence officials said last year that Russia sought to influence the 2016 presidential election through similar means.
