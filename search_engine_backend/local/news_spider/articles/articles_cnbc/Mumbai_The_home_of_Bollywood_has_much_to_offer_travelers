&quot;It&#39;s a great place to work, maybe not the greatest place in India to live,&quot; said Kevin Lee, a reporter for CNBC TV18 who has lived and worked in the city for several years.

&quot;The whole essence of Mumbai is functionality, nobody has time to sit around and talk, everybody is just going somewhere,&quot; he said.
