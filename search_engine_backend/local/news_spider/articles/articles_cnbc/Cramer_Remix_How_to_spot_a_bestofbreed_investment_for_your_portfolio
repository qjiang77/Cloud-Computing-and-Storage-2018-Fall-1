Cramer Remix: How to spot a best-of-breed investment for your portfolio|http://www.cnbc.com/mad-money|http://www.cnbc.com/2017/02/21/cramer-stocks-that-are-the-best-of-breed-for-investing.html||2017-02-21|Abigail Stevenson,Getty Images,Rafal Rodzoch,Caiaimage||When Cramer was growing up, he had to learn how to invest the hard way. His father &quot;Pop&quot; worked very hard selling boxes and bags to retailers, and it was tough to save money back then. Pop had money in a bank account, but it didn&#39;t pay much interest.

One day Pop announced that he was going to take that money and buy the stock of National Video because his brother heard from a guy named Jack that it was the next big thing. At first the stock went up dramatically, and Pop was so happy he kept buying more.



In fact, that was all Pop knew about the stock. He did not follow it intraday and had not researched the company. Eventually the stock started to plummet, and Pop lost everything on the investment.

&quot;All I can say is that I&#39;m glad for two things: one is that Pop never borrowed money to buy National Video, and two that stocks blessedly stop at zero on the way down,&quot; Cramer said.

After losing money on a few investments himself, Cramer decided to go to the library and research companies. Eventually, he found a company called Natomas, which had just discovered a large find in Indonesia. He took $300 and bought the stock, and it quickly caught a takeover bid.



Cramer realized from his investment in Natomas that by doing the homework, it gave him an edge over others and helped to arm him with the proper knowledge about a stock. He was hooked on stocks and never turned back. Eventually, Cramer made enough money to pay for his first year of law school at Harvard when he decided to become an attorney.

&quot;I recognized that you can study, and you can pick worthwhile stocks that might be doing better than the average stock and that can, indeed, augment your savings provided you do it right, have some edge and stay current on the company,&quot; Cramer said.
