When CNBC&#39;s Jim Cramer heard from a caller weighing the pros and cons of investing in Home Depot, Lowe&#39;s and Floor & Decor, he wondered why things needed to be so confusing.

&quot;Why do we overcomplicate things? We&#39;ve got Home Depot. We&#39;ve got a new manager who&#39;s real good at Lowe&#39;s and we&#39;ve got Floor & Decor. What, are we going to own them all?&quot; the &quot;Mad Money&quot; host asked on Friday.

Instead of trying to balance owning shares in all three home improvement retailers, Cramer recommended going for the best of breed players.

&quot;Home Depot, at $190, I said was unbelievable. And you know what? I&#39;m reiterating Home Depot and I have to tell you, if Lowe&#39;s comes down, [it&#39;s] probably worth buying, too,&quot; he said. &quot;But don&#39;t buy them all.&quot;
