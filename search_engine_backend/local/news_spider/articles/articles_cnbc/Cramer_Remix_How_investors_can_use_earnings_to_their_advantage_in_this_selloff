Sell-offs that occur during earnings season often provide great opportunities for investors to build positions in top-notch stocks, CNBC&#39;s Jim Cramer argued Thursday as the market compounded its monthly losses.

&quot;In a sell-off during earnings season, you can&#39;t have a lot of guesswork. You want to be sure you&#39;re buying companies that you absolutely know are doing well,&quot; the &quot;Mad Money&quot; host said. &quot;That&#39;s what&#39;s so great about sell-offs in the reporting period: you&#39;ve got the perfect shopping list because the companies have just told you exactly how they&#39;re doing.&quot;

And while the sell-off might not be over yet, as Cramer&#39;s colleague and technician Mark Sebastian predicted on Tuesday, Cramer spotted some stellar buying opportunities in the widespread weakness.

&quot;I think these are levels, if you have a lot of cash, where you can pick a stock and start nibbling,&quot; he said. &quot;You want a high-quality situation at a discount, where you know the merchandise isn&#39;t damaged, just the stock.&quot;

Right now, four stocks fit the bill, Cramer said. Click here to see his recommendations.
