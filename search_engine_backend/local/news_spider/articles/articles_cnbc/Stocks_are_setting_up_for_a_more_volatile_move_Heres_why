Stocks are setting up for a more volatile move. Here's why.|http://www.cnbc.com/keris-lahiff|http://finance.yahoo.com/blogs/talking-numbers/stocks-are-setting-up-for-a-more-volatile-move--here-s-why-223949417.html||2015-02-26|Lawrence Lewitinn||The “fear index” has fallen once more as stocks make new highs.

The CBOE Volatility Index (the “VIX”), which started the month off at 20, is now trading below 14. The VIX, which is a measure of the market’s expectations of future volatility in the S&P 500, is often called the fear index because it tends to rally when stocks sell off.

But with the VIX declining for much of this month, does it mean the market has become too complacent?

One portfolio advisor says the VIX should be at these levels. “There is a lot less uncertainty,” said Erin Gibbs, equity chief investment officer at S&P Capital IQ Global Market Intelligence.

She sees lessened uncertainty with Greece, stabilizing oil prices and the low interest-rate expectations for the near term as reasons why volatility will stay down.

“When you combine those three factors, it is rational at the time being to have low volatility,” said Gibbs, who has over $15 billion in assets under advisory.

However, the technicals are showing the VIX may move higher, based on the chart work of Todd Gordon, founder of TradingAnalysis.com. He disagrees with Gibbs on her oil and interest rate outlooks.

“Crude oil might be just consolidating before we have another push down,” said Gordon, a CNBC contributor. “We have seen a bond market selloff and interest rate spike, which I think is going to help push volatility higher.”

Gordon maintains there are similarities between the current market and how it behaved in the early part of 2014. He anticipates history to repeat itself.

After a selloff in stocks in January 2014, “The S&P [500] proceeded to new highs in March, [while] the VIX did not … make new lows,” Gordon said. “We are about one month behind last year. I think we could be set up for a little bit of a pullback in the S&P. And if seasonality is to hold, volatility should remain high above the lows set at the end of last year.”

The VIX closed 2014 at the 19.20 level.

For that reason, Gordon said he would take a position in the VIX. “I am net long the stock market, but I am looking to buy volatility as a hedge,” he said.
