'Intense effort' fails to seal UK-EU Brexit deal after surprise Sunday talks|https://www.cnbc.com|https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/14/eu-ambassadors-gather-as-push-for-brexit-deal-accelerates.html||2018-10-14|Dursun Aydemir,Anadolu Agency,Getty Images||The European Union's top Brexit negotiator says urgent talks with Britain's point person did not result in their reaching agreement on outstanding issues.

EU negotiator Michel Barnier said: "Despite intense efforts, some key issues are still open" in the divorce talks between the European Union and Britain. Barnier and his British counterpart, Dominic Raab, met in Brussels for surprise talks on Sunday.

The discussion prompted rumors that a full agreement might be imminent, but Barnier says the future of the border on the island of Ireland remain a serious obstacle. He says the need "to avoid a hard border" between Ireland and the U.K's Northern Ireland is among the unsettled issues.

An EU official says no further negotiations are planned before an EU leaders summit on Wednesday.
