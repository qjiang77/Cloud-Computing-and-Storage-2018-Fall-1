Trump Organization's Scottish housing plan receives record number of objections|http://www.cnbc.com/real-estate|http://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/16/trump-organizations-scottish-housing-plan-receives-record-number-of-objections.html||2018-10-16|Chloe Taylor,Getty Images||The Trump Organization has received a record number of objections to its proposed new housing estate in Scotland, a local councillor told CNBC Tuesday.

More than 3,000 locals have submitted formal objections to the company&#39;s plans, which include the construction of around 500 private homes near the Trump Golf Course in the village of Balmedie, Aberdeenshire.

A petition from campaign group &quot;Tripping up Trump&quot; has also gained almost 19,000 signatures to stop the luxury homes from being granted planning permission.

The houses will be sold for over £1 million ($1.32 million) each, the campaign group said on its petition&#39;s webpage in August.

The resistance among residents is a far cry from the local response to Trump&#39;s 2007 proposal to build a 450-room hotel resort, which gained public support despite being contrary to planning policy.

According to local councillor Martin Ford, residents supported Trump a decade ago when they associated his celebrity status with investment – but he noted that the now-President&#39;s reputation has since changed.

&quot;Mr Trump&#39;s proposed housing scheme has attracted far more objections than any other housing proposal in the history of Aberdeenshire,&quot; he told CNBC over the phone on Tuesday.

&quot;When you go back to the big application in 2007, there were over 2,000 letters of support for the proposals and about a thousand objections. Fast forward to now and you&#39;re down from about 2,000 support letters to about two, while the number of objections is over 3,000. It&#39;s perfectly obvious that public opinion has shifted on Mr Trump.&quot;

A decision on the Trump Organization&#39;s housing estate is due either at the end of this year or in early 2019, Ford said.
