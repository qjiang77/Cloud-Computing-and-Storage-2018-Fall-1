Medical marijuana company Tilray, whose stock has posted a meteoric rise on the Nasdaq since its initial U.S. offering in July, shed more than 6 percent Wednesday. Canopy Growth, another favorite in the space, lost 3.5 percent on the New York Stock Exchange. Tilray is up 750 percent from its IPO price of $17 while Canopy is up about 100 percent since mid-July.

Some members of Wall Street&#39;s cannabis community cautioned that the rapid rise in pot stock prices could be followed by modest sales in the early innings of legalization, including the top analyst in the space.

&quot;While the opportunity is large, the market is going to develop in phases both in terms of product availability as well as retail access points,&quot; Cowen analyst Vivien Azer told CNBC in an interview Tuesday. &quot;For product availability on day one it&#39;s going to be pretty limited: no traditional vapor products, beverages or edibles. That could take as much as a year.&quot;

Aurora Cannabis dropped 1.5 percent in Canadian trading, while Cronos Group lost 5 percent in Toronto. The ETFMG Alternative Harvest exchange-traded fund — one of Wall Street&#39;s favorite marijuana ETFs — fell 3 percent in the session.
