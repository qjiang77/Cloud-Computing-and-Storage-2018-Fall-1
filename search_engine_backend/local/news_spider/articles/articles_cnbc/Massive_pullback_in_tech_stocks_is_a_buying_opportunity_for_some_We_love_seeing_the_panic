Massive pullback in tech stocks is a buying opportunity for some: 'We love seeing the panic'|http://www.cnbc.com/patti-domm|http://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/11/pullback-in-tech-stocks-spells-anxiety-for-some-opportunity-for-others.html||2018-10-11|Thomas Franck,Andrew Harrer,Bloomberg,Getty Images||Three experts debate whether the recent tech stock turmoil could continue 10:44 AM ET Wed, 10 Oct 2018 | 01:43

Tech shares were set to drop again Thursday, a day after rising interest rates and a trade war between the United States and China exacerbated technology's sell-off and pushed the sector to its worst levels on Wall Street since 2011.

Wednesday's pullback, which contributed to the S&P 500's worst day since February, left many investors wondering what happened to the once red-hot trade and where to go next.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 831.83 points Wednesday as Intel and Microsoft fell more than 3.5 percent each. The Nasdaq Composite, which broke below its 200-day moving average, plummeted 4 percent to 7,422.05. The S&P 500 technology sector dropped 3.2 percent Wednesday with 52 out of 65 components — or 80 percent of the sector — closing in correction levels or worse as the sector posted its worst day since Aug. 18, 2011.
