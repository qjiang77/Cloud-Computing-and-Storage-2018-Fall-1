Icon Ventures' Horowitz expands fund to stay relevant amid megafunds|http://www.cnbc.com|http://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/20/icon-ventures-horowitz-expands-fund-to-stay-relevant-amid-megafunds.html||2018-10-20|Sara Salinas,Source,Icon Ventures,Boston Dynamics||Joe Horowitz is a venture capital traditionalist.

He believes in best practices, business fundamentals and calculated bets. But as megafunds and hundred-million-dollar rounds balloon valuations and flood the space, the Icon Ventures managing general partner finds himself fighting money with money.

&quot;If we don&#39;t adjust to the reality of the implications of what the megafunds mean for us, we&#39;re at risk for our business,&quot; Horowitz told CNBC in an interview. &quot;To be relevant today ... you need enough capital.&quot;

Icon Ventures plans to announce the expansion of its most recent fund by an additional $110 million. Icon&#39;s Fund VI had previously closed at $265 million, but is now getting a 40 percent bump to $375 million in committed capital.

&quot;When we look at the kind of rounds that we&#39;re invested in — with some of the best firms on the planet — we need more capital,&quot; said Horowitz.

Icon focuses on Series B and C rounds, and counts successful exits in companies like 41st Parameter and Calypto and in now-public companies like FireEye and Palo Alto Networks. The firm manages more than $1 billion in total.

But megafunds like SoftBank are raising the ante, inflating valuations and pushing the market toward correction, Horowitz said.

&quot;I have a lot of respect for [SoftBank CEO] Masa Son, but the notion of $100 billion when success in our world is a $20 billion outcome — it&#39;s a very different business,&quot; he said. &quot;Venture capital is more about metering in money at different size financings as the company demonstrates the right kind of progress.&quot;

Icon&#39;s newest financing will help the firm compete, though it won&#39;t be shifting investment strategy soon. Horowitz said the extra $110 million will be invested in software, security and consumer deals — like much of its previous funding.

Icon will also look at the internet of things and blockchain applications that it finds &quot;compelling and legitimate,&quot; Horowitz said.
