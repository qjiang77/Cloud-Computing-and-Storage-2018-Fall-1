The firm reiterated its overweight rating for Stryker shares, predicting the medical technology company will report earnings above expectations next year.

&quot;We see multiple top-line drivers [for Stryker], including new product launches in multiple businesses (Knees, Instruments, Neuro, & Physio-Control at the top of the list),&quot; analyst Robbie Marcus said in a note to clients Thursday. &quot;Following a solid start to the year, we expect more of the same in the balance of 2018 with the company easily outperforming Street expectations on both the top and bottom lines.&quot;
