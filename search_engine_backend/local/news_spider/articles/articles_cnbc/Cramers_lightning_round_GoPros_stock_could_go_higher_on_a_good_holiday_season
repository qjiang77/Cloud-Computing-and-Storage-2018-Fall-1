Cramer's lightning round: GoPro's stock could go higher on a 'good holiday season'|http://www.cnbc.com|http://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/19/cramers-lightning-round-gopros-stock-could-go-higher-after-holidays.html||2018-10-19|Elizabeth Gurdus||GoPro Inc.: &quot;I think that GoPro&#39;s going to have a good holiday season. They&#39;ve got all new stuff. I think it could trade to $8, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s getting more than that because it&#39;s pretty darn speculative.&quot;

Eli Lilly and Co.: &quot;I think Eli Lilly is very good, but it has had such a run that I can no longer countenance buying it up at these levels.&quot;

HealthEquity Inc.: &quot;I think it&#39;s interesting. I mean, look, I think that if Paychex decided they wanted to get into that business, exactly in that niche, I think that they could do great and they could actually do it pretty well through corporations, so I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s a big enough moat there.&quot;

General Mills Inc.: &quot;They bought this Blue Buffalo. Here&#39;s the problem: I don&#39;t like the stock because they took down too much money to pay for Blue Buffalo. They overpaid. They&#39;ve bought a lot of stock much higher and then they&#39;re selling lower. That is not my kind of company.&quot;

Marriott Intl.: &quot;This is just people just saying the business cycle&#39;s reaching a conclusion. It&#39;s all about the Fed, otherwise Marriott would be higher because [CEO] Arne [Sorenson]&#39;s doing a great job.&quot;
