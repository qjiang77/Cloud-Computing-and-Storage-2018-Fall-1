Stocks To Watch: Was That A Speed Bump?|http://www.cnbc.com/quotes|https://seekingalpha.com/article/4211431-stocks-watch-speed-bump?source=cnbc||2018-10-13|Sa Stocks To Watch||Welcome to Seeking Alpha's Stocks to Watch - a preview of key events scheduled for the next week.

That escalated quickly. While we gave a gentle reminder last week that interest rates would be a major topic ahead, we missed the magnitude of anxiety by more than a few degrees. But not to worry, a cavalcade of earnings reports and the Treasury Department's FX policy report due out next week could easily shift the focus off rates. Secretary Steven Mnuchin is either going to accept the reported conclusion of Treasury staff that China isn't manipulating the yuan to remove a source of anxiety from markets or declare China a currency manipulator. It's a pretty big question mark hanging in the wind and it follows Mnuchin (perhaps not playing ball) saying the stock market plunge was just a "natural correction" not a FOMC-created event. China and trade are also going to be major topics on earnings conference calls as witnessed last week when the retail sector was rocked by news on LVMH's (OTCPK:LVMHF) call of a customs crackdown on Chinese luxury imports. Along with the China/trade wildcard, execs will also be pressed on labor and input cost inflation as they post their guidance updates. You can follow all the riveting drama with the transcripts as they roll in on Seeking Alpha's transcripts page.

Barron's mentions: The impact of higher interest rates on stocks is broken down in detail in this week's edition in a sector-by-sector analysis. Banking giants JPMorgan (JPM), Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), and Bank of America (BAC) are seen having "particularly large benefits" from higher rates because they've been growing deposits more quickly than the rest of the industry. There's a warning that higher rates could lure investors away from Amazon (AMZN) and Netflix (NFLX) because they pay no dividends and sport high valuations. Meanwhile, cash-flow machines Cisco (CSCO) and IBM (IBM) could hold up better than some of their tech peers. The complicated tracking relationship between Dell Technologies (NYSE:DVMT) and VMware (NYSE:VMW) is dissected. Anheuser-Busch InBev (NYSE:BUD) is tapped by the publication as a stock that could see double-digit returns.
