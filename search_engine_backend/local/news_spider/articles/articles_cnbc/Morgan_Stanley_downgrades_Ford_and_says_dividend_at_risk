Morgan Stanley downgrades Ford and says dividend at risk|http://www.cnbc.com/phil-lebeau|http://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/19/ford-shares-fall-after-morgan-stanley-downgrades-it-on-dividend-risk.html||2018-10-19|Robert Ferris,Rebecca Cook||Morgan Stanley downgraded Ford on Friday, saying its earnings and cash flow are under pressure and its dividend is at risk.

The number two U.S. automaker is suffering from a perception among investors that it lacks transparency and is failing to take quick, decisive action in executing its turnaround plan, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said in a note.

&quot;While we do believe investors will eventually pay for details and execution, we think the market needs more evidence of success before embracing the Ford restructuring story,&quot; Jonas said.

Jonas downgraded Ford from overweight, the equivalent of a buy rating, to equal weight, which is essentially a hold. He lowered his 12- to 18-month price target from $14 to $10 a share.
