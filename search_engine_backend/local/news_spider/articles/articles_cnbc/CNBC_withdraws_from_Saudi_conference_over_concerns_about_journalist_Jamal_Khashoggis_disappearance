CNBC is withdrawing from a conference scheduled for this month in Saudi Arabia, as global outrage grows over the disappearance and suspected slaying of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

&quot;CNBC will no longer participate in the FII in Riyadh due to the continuing questions surrounding the disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi,&quot; the network said on Twitter.

CNBC&#39;s decision comes as other luminaries and media outlets pulled out of the Future Investment Initiative, also known as &quot;Davos in the Desert,&quot; which is scheduled for Oct. 23 to 25. Earlier Friday, the Financial Times pulled out of the conference. CNN and The New York Times had also withdrawn, as has Los Angeles Times owner Patrick Soon-Shiong.

Times columnist and CNBC anchor Andrew Ross Sorkin announced on Twitter that he would withdraw from the conference, citing concerns about the disappearance of Khashoggi &quot;and reports of his murder.&quot;

Bloomberg News also said Friday that it was withdrawing from the conference, although it plans to cover news that might come out of it.
