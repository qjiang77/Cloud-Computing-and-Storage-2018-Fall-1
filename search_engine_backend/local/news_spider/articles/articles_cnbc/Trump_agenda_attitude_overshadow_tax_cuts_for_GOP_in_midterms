Trump agenda, attitude overshadow tax cuts for GOP in midterms|http://www.cnbc.com/ylan-mui|http://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/17/trump-agenda-attitude-overshadow-tax-cuts-for-gop-in-midterms.html||2018-10-17|Ylan Mui,Karen James Sloan||DOWNERS GROVE, Ill. — Rep. Peter Roskam has spent months preaching the benefits of Republicans&#39; $1.5 trillion tax cut to voters in his suburban swing district just outside of Chicago.

Roskam, a chief architect of the sweeping new law, argues it has jump-started economic growth. He credits the tax cuts with replenishing Medicare&#39;s health insurance fund, galvanizing manufacturing in his district and spurring companies to hire more workers.

But there&#39;s one thing they may not be able to do: save his own job.

&quot;This race is close because we&#39;re in a tumultuous season in our public life,&quot; Roskam said in an interview with CNBC.

The tax cuts were supposed to be the centerpiece of the Republican campaign in the midterm elections. Instead, the GOP&#39;s singular legislative achievement has been overshadowed by trade tensions, the fight over the Supreme Court and President Donald Trump&#39;s Twitter feed.

Now Roskam is on the front lines of the battle for control of Congress. The voters in his district are affluent, well-educated — and, along with moderates suburbs like this one across the country, starting to lean to the left.

A recent poll shows Roskam slipping behind his Democratic opponent, political newcomer Sean Casten. Outside liberal groups are funding a late-stage ad blitz, and Casten announced one of the largest fundraising hauls of any congressional race during the third quarter.

&quot;No one would&#39;ve thought that Peter Roskam would be in any trouble,&quot; said Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Sabato&#39;s Crystal Ball, a political newsletter published by the University of Virginia&#39;s Center for Politics. &quot;But Trump taking over the Republican Party … has had negatives in some places, too, and this district is a prime example.&quot;
