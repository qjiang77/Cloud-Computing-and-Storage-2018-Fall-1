Cramer's lightning round: Don't be like the Fed if you're holding this stock|http://www.cnbc.com/mad-money|http://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/18/cramers-lightning-round-dont-be-like-the-fed-if-you-own-amarin.html||2018-10-18|Elizabeth Gurdus||Amarin Corp.: &quot;We&#39;re going to take out our cost basis tomorrow, even though that heart drug is pretty good. Tomorrow, you take out the cost basis and you can&#39;t lose. As a matter of fact, I would take out double my cost basis because that stock&#39;s in the $20s now. So that&#39;s how we&#39;re going to play it. We&#39;re going to be prudent. We&#39;re not going to be like the Fed. We&#39;re not going to be judgmental; we&#39;re going to be prudent.&quot;

Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals Inc.: &quot;They have a tie-in with one of my favorite stocks, JNJ, which holds up very well. It&#39;s a great spec. Let&#39;s leave it at that: it&#39;s a great spec.&quot;

AT&T: &quot;I am willing to endorse AT&T, but I have to tell you, if you want a little more safety, you really do have to go to Verizon, which is up a lot more but I know it&#39;s got a less stretched balance sheet.&quot;

3M Co.: &quot;It&#39;s down $59 bucks from its 52-week high. Now, I have to tell you, in pure candor, I discussed with [TheStreet analysts] Zev Fima and with Jeff Marks today whether we shouldn&#39;t trim the position ahead of the quarter for our charitable trust and tell the club members that we&#39;re less certain. It&#39;s already a small position. I am very concerned about the Oct. 23 report if they do not do a restructuring. I think it&#39;ll be disappointing. I&#39;m putting it out there.&quot;

HollyFrontier Corp.: &quot;Stop sweating the program. HollyFrontier is great. Now, I do like Marathon [Petroleum] more and we know I like Valero more because we did our power rankings the other day, but that&#39;s a good company. I am not going to fret that. And as a matter of fact, I&#39;d love to have them back on the air because they are so good at telling their story.&quot;

Brinker Intl.: &quot;I&#39;ve always been a fan, but I have to tell you, the stock that everybody likes right now is McDonald&#39;s. I&#39;m not going to back away from that. I am also a fan of Wendy&#39;s.&quot;

Viper Energy Partners: &quot;I would say don&#39;t buy. Not up here; too dangerous. It&#39;s a nice move that it&#39;s had, up 60 percent.&quot;
