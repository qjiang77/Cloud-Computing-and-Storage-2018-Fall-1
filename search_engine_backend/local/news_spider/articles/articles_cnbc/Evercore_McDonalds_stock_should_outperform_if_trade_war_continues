Evercore: McDonald's stock should outperform if trade war continues|http://www.cnbc.com/netnet|http://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/15/evercore-mcdonalds-stock-should-outperform-if-trade-war-continues.html||2018-10-15|Michael Sheetz,Getty Images||Evercore ISI upgraded shares of McDonald&#39;s to outperform from in line on Monday, saying the company is well-positioned to ride out the trade war between the U.S. and China.

&quot;[McDonald&#39;s] is the most defensive restaurant stock, it has less exposure to emerging economies, and the stock will likely outperform should equity volatility related to trade persist,&quot; Evercore analyst Matt McGinley said in a note.

McDonald&#39;s shares rose 0.4 percent Monday morning.

McGinley noted that McDonald&#39;s rode out the previous global recession well, thanks to the company&#39;s defensive position. McDonald&#39;s stock outperformed the S&P 500 index by 82 percent and the company continued to grow its operating profit, according to the analyst. The global fast-food chain has only become more defensive over the last decade, according to McGinley. While McDonald&#39;s was 20 percent company-owned during the last global recession, it is now only 7 percent company-owned today.

Compared with the rest of the restaurant industry, McDonald&#39;s economies of scale is of &quot;increasing importance amid labor inflation, remodel investment, and a higher promotional cadence.&quot; As those shifts in the industry happen, McGinley said, restaurant chains will need &quot;greater sophistication to plan, execute, and evolve.&quot;

Evercore does not have a price target on shares of McDonald&#39;s but does have a &quot;base case&quot; of $185 a share.
