Uber raises $2 billion in debut junk bond sale ahead of blockbuster IPO|http://www.cnbc.com/phil-lebeau|http://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/18/uber-raises-2-billion-in-debut-junk-bond-sale-ahead-of-ipo.html||2018-10-18|Ryan Browne,Anindito Mukherjee,Getty Images,Handout||Uber has raised $2 billion in a junk bond sale as it gears up for its 2019 stock market debut.

The ride-hailing firm confirmed to CNBC that it had raised $1.5 billion through the sale of eight-year notes with a yield of 8 percent — it had initially pitched $1 billion — and an additional $500 million by selling five-year notes with a yield of 7.5 percent in a private placement led by Morgan Stanley. The news was originally reported by the Financial Times.

The embattled start-up is preparing for an initial public offering that media reports have noted could value it at more than $100 billion — far more than its last reported valuation of $72 billion, which it notched after a $500 million capital injection from Japanese carmaker Toyota. It is currently one of the most valuable privately held firms in the world.

The fundraising follows a separate report by the FT on Wednesday that said Uber has mulled the sale of minority stakes in its struggling self-driving unit, known as the Advanced Technologies Group.

&quot;Shared self-driving cars will ultimately make transportation safer, more efficient, and more affordable for riders on the Uber network,&quot; the company said in an emailed statement to CNBC in response to that report.

&quot;Our team at the Advanced Technologies Group is wholly focused on building the safest self-driving technology out there, and we remain committed to supporting their efforts to make this self-driving future a reality.&quot;

The autonomous driving unit suffered a major setback earlier this year after a fatal crash involving one of its driverless vehicles in Tempe, Arizona. It also ended a legal battle with Google&#39;s self-driving car division Waymo in February, with a settlement that saw Waymo take a 0.34 percent stake in the company worth $245 million at the time.

Uber&#39;s Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi said last month the firm is on track to launch its IPO next year and has no plans to sell the Advanced Technologies Group.

A spokesperson for Morgan Stanley declined to comment when contacted by CNBC.
