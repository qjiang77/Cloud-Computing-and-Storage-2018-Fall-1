On technology stocks: "I think all of these stocks it's all a question of relative value. When you look on a price to earnings basis. These are one of the few sets of companies that are predictably growing true earnings," he said. "They actually are generating real change, real innovation, making real money ... I much rather be long Netflix, Facebook, Amazon and Google than for example Wal-Mart, Target, CVS etc.
