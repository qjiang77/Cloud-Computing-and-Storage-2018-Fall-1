Mid-to-late August tends to be the time of year when earnings season &quot;goes out with a whimper, not a bang,&quot; CNBC&#39;s Jim Cramer said on Friday.

But that doesn&#39;t mean there&#39;s no opportunity in the stock market, the &quot;Mad Money&quot; host said.

Cramer argued that the lack of earnings reports will actually give investors time to do their homework and make informed investing decisions amid the market-moving trade war and other unforeseen corporate news.

&quot;There&#39;s plenty of time to study and critique and calibrate and make considered judgments because, at last, the number of earnings reports that happen each day ... slow[s] to a trickle,&quot; he told investors.

With that in mind, Cramer turned to his weekly game plan, complete with earnings reports from Home Depot, Macy&#39;s and Canopy Growth Corp.

But for Cramer, Cisco&#39;s earnings report will be the most important one of the week as Wall Street keeps a close eye on CEO Chuck Robbins&#39; push to make Cisco more of a security-focused software subscription enterprise.

Praising Robbins and his team for &quot;moving mountains&quot; to build Cisco&#39;s recurring revenue stream, Cramer acknowledged that other companies that have made the transition to selling software have had &quot;some growing pains.&quot;

&quot;I expect Cisco will deliver a good quarter,&quot; he said. &quot;Maybe it won&#39;t be the monster grower that some want, but I believe the re-positioning of Cisco into high-growth mode will take a little time. Be patient.&quot;
