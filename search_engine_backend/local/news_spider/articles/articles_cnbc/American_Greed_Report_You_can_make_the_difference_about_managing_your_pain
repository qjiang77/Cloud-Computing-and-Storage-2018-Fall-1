American Greed Report: You can make the difference about managing your pain|https://www.cnbc.com|https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/01/american-greed-report-you-can-make-the-difference-about-managing-your-pain.html||2018-03-01|Scott Cohn||While the role of doctors and drug companies in the opioid epidemic is still the subject of some debate, the case of Couch and Ruan points to a hard reality for pain sufferers. In your search for relief, you must also search for a practitioner who will not make things much worse.

Not-so-great expectations

Dr. Christopher Gharibo, a pain specialist at NYU Langone Health in New York, says it is important for patients to be realistic about what pain therapy will achieve.

&quot;Your doctor can&#39;t eliminate your pain,&quot; he said. &quot;You&#39;re probably still going to have some degree of mild to moderate pain. Your doctor is there to take away a considerable part of your pain, but they cannot eliminate it.&quot;

To maximize the potential effectiveness, come armed in your first visit with as much information about yourself as possible.

&quot;Bring up your other medical problems and whether you had surgery in the painful area, for example, neck surgery, spine surgery, lower back surgery, hip replacement, knee replacement – all of that is very important information,&quot; Gharibo said.

Be prepared to tell your doctor about any other medications you are taking — both prescription and over the counter — as well as the dosage. And let him or her know whether anything has or has not worked in the past if the pain is recurring.

Opioid alternatives

The addiction crisis has already led doctors to cut back on prescribing opioids. When they do prescribe them, they do so for much shorter periods of time than they once did.

&quot;Now a typical prescription tends to be, for chronic pain, about a month or so,&quot; Gharibo said. &quot;That used to go month after month and sometimes for many years.&quot;

But he acknowledges that dependency can develop in as little as two weeks, which helps explain why doctors and patients are increasingly viewing opioids as more of a last resort for pain, and looking more seriously at non-opioid treatments.

&quot;A foundation of therapy needs to be tried that is comprised of non-pharmacological therapies, physiotherapy, proper body mechanics, proper posture, what to do, what not to do, taking care of your body, weight loss, proper diet; over-the-counter medications,&quot; Gharibo said.

If none of that works, and if there is no success in addressing the underlying disease, there still may be alternatives to opioids.

&quot;You could consider getting, for example, a trigger-point injector with local anesthetics, or a nerve block of some kind that can ... address the pain without putting on a daily dose of opioids or non-opioids or any medication therapy,&quot; he said.

Even if the treatment escalates to controlled substances — opioid or not — moderation is key. Where in the past doctors might have simply tried raising the dosage if a drug does not work, now they are rethinking that strategy when it comes to painkillers.

&quot;If they&#39;re failing, it doesn&#39;t mean we go up and up on the dose,&quot; Gharibo said, &quot;but we should be switching to another controlled substance potentially to try to capture the pain.&quot;

If your doctor is not being careful in that way, ask him or her why not, and consider asking for a second opinion.

Don&#39;t heal thyself

If you are not getting the relief you need, do not attempt to take matters into your own hands.

The American Academy of Pain Medicine offers a set of safety principles for patients and caregivers who are dealing with opioids. They include:

* Never take an opioid medication that is not prescribed to you.

* Never adjust your own doses.

* Never mix the medication with alcohol.

It is also important to know yourself, and be honest. Gharibo says some patients are more susceptible to addiction than others.

&quot;A younger patient has a higher probability of getting addicted,&quot; he said. &quot;A young male, for example, (more) than somebody elderly. Patients with a history of psychiatric disorders, patients with history of anxiety, past addictions and past controlled substance use, history of tobacco – all those are potential predictors of addiction.&quot;

If any of those descriptions apply to you — and even if they do not — be careful about agreeing to be treated with an opioid painkiller.

Couch and Ruan counted on patients who were so desperate for relief that they would not ask the right questions. The result was untold pain for victims and their loved ones.
