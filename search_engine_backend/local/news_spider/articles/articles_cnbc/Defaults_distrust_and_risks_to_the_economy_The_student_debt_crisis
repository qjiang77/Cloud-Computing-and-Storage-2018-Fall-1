He owns a three-bedroom ranch-style house in Charlottesville, Virginia, where he lives with his wife and 3-year-old son, Benjamin. He recently made the last payment on his silver, Toyota Tacoma. He likes his job.

But there&#39;s one problem that won&#39;t go away.

Strong and his wife owe more than $350,000 for their bachelor&#39;s and master&#39;s degrees.

&quot;The huge monster in the closet for me are these student loans that keep getting bigger and bigger,&quot; said Strong, 36. When they graduated, they were faced with monthly bills of around $800 each and have since struggled to keep up.
