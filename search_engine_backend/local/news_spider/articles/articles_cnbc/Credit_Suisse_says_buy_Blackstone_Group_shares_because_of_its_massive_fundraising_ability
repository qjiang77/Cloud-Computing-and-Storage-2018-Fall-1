The firm reiterated its outperform rating for Blackstone Group shares, predicting the company will generate earnings above expectations in 2020.

Fee-related earnings growth should "significantly re-accelerate" in 2019 and 2020 because of Blackstone's massive fundraising pipeline, Credit Suisse analyst Craig Siegenthaler said in a note to clients Tuesday. "Given the secular growth drivers in the industry (migration to illiquid alts, share gains by large/one-stop-shop platforms) and qualities of the public alternative business model (locked-up capital, fees on fixed invested capital/not NAV), we continue to find the industry attractive relative to the broader market and financial sector."
