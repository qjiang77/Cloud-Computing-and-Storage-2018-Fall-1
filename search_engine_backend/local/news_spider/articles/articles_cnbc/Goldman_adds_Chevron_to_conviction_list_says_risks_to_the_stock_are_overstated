Goldman adds Chevron to conviction list, says risks to the stock are 'overstated'|http://www.cnbc.com/pro|http://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/02/goldman-adds-chevron-to-conviction-list-says-risks-overstated.html||2018-10-02|Fred Imbert,Tom Strickland,Bloomberg,Getty Images,Scott Mlyn,Chip Chipman,Victor J. Blue,Alex Wong,Andrew Harrer,Morsa Images||Shares of Chevron will rally more than 14 percent in the next year as its underperformance creates a &quot;compelling entry point&quot; for investors, according to Goldman Sachs.

The investment bank added Chevron to its Americas conviction buy list with a price target of $142. The target is 14.2 percent above Monday&#39;s closing price.

Chevron has lagged the S&P 500 and the energy ETF this year despite a 20 percent jump in the price of Brent crude oil, analyst Neil Mehta said in a note Monday. The bear case for Chevron consists, in part of, poor earnings execution over the past year and a lack of preparedness for changes to the International Maritime Organization&#39;s (IMO) new emissions standards coming online in 2020.

&quot;We believe many of these risks are overstated and are also more than priced into the stock,&quot; Mehta said.
