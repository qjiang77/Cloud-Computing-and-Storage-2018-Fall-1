Chart shows how everything has changed since Trump became president|https://www.cnbc.com|https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/20/chart-shows-how-everything-has-changed-since-trump-became-president.html||2018-10-20|Jeff Cox,Jonathan Ernst||Since Donald Trump won the presidency, he has presided over both one the most tumultuous political times in recent memory, as well as the best economy the country has seen since well before the financial crisis. Consumer and small business confidence is up â€” but so are both the national debt and budget deficit.

Of course, the stock market has weakened in October, which has been its historically most volatile month. The chart doesn&#39;t include GDP, which has averaged 2.72 percent since Trump took over, compared to the 1.6 percent gain in 2016.

But the numbers provide a solid overview of how conditions have evolved during the 45th president&#39;s time in office.
