1 in 4 Venmo users' actions on the app can be monetized, PayPal CFO says|http://www.cnbc.com|http://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/19/paypal-cfo-1-in-4-venmo-users-actions-on-app-can-be-monetized.html||2018-10-19|Elizabeth Gurdus||A quarter of Venmo users are currently using PayPal&#39;s millennial-friendly payments app in a way that the financial technology company can monetize, PayPal Chief Financial Officer John Rainey told CNBC on Friday.

&quot;If we look at the most recent quarter, roughly one in four Venmo customers are using Venmo in a way today that we&#39;re able to monetize,&quot; Rainey said in an exclusive interview with &quot;Mad Money&quot; host Jim Cramer.

&quot;That could be with using Venmo to shop online, it could be using our physical card in a store, or it could be using the instant cash withdrawal so they can transfer funds immediately into their bank account,&quot; the CFO continued.

Speaking after PayPal&#39;s strong earnings report sent shares of the payments giant up more than 9 percent in Friday&#39;s trading session, Rainey reiterated CEO Dan Schulman&#39;s comments about Venmo reaching a &quot;tipping point.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a bit of an inflection point for us,&quot; Rainey told Cramer, whose charitable trust owns shares of PayPal. &quot;We saw growth ... of almost 80 percent in terms of total volume for Venmo in the quarter. That&#39;s the second quarter in a row that we&#39;ve grown at that rate, and so we&#39;re just really excited about what we&#39;re seeing with this part of our platform.&quot;

While Venmo was a key driver for PayPal this quarter, it wasn&#39;t the company&#39;s only win: the fintech player added 9.1 million net new active users to its platform, an all-time record, announced an expanded partnership with American Express and struck a new agreement with Walmart to offer deposit and withdrawal services at its stores.

Rainey said the partnerships would be instrumental to drawing even more customers to PayPal&#39;s increasingly &quot;relevant&quot; platform, which now boasts over a quarter of a billion users.

Moreover, PayPal is still focused on the roughly two billion people around the world who don&#39;t have access to financial services that many people &quot;take for granted,&quot; like banking or checking accounts, he said.

&quot;Financial inclusion is part of our mission,&quot; he told Cramer. &quot;The key element of those two billion people is that roughly 70 percent of them have a mobile device. And this is where our value proposition really shines, where we can put all of the power of mobile commerce in the palm of their hand.&quot;

That, paired with the almost &quot;viral&quot; popularity of the Venmo app, sets PayPal apart from traditional financial services companies or even newer fintech competitors, Rainey said.

&quot;There are very few companies, Jim, that I would put into the same category as us,&quot; the CFO said. &quot;We&#39;re a high-growth company, but we also generate a tremendous amount of free cash flow for a growth company like ours.&quot;
