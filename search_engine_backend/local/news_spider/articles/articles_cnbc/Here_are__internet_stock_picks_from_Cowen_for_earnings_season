Here are the five outperform-rated Cowen internet stock picks and the 12-month price forecasts.



1) Amazon



Cowen&#39;s Amazon price target is $1,050, representing 16 percent upside from Thursday&#39;s close. The company will report first-quarter earnings on Apr. 27.

&quot;AMZN remains our top idea for 2017 â€¦ Our bullish thesis remains unchanged: We believe AMZN will continue to win in large &#39;non-core&#39; retail markets, specifically food & bev grocery, consumables, and apparel, at the expense of traditional retailers and local merchants. Moreover, we continue to believe it&#39;s still early days for eCommerce, and AMZN is best positioned to capture the accelerating shift of dollars from offline to online.&quot;
