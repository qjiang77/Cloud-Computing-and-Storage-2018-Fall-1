Cramer's game plan: Increased volatility could turn positive with help from Trump, Fed|http://www.cnbc.com/mad-money|http://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/12/cramers-game-plan-higher-volatility-could-turn-positive-for-stocks.html||2018-10-12|Elizabeth Gurdus||UnitedHealth and Johnson & Johnson: Both holdings in Cramer&#39;s charitable trust, health care giants UnitedHealth and Johnson & Johnson will report earnings Tuesday morning.

&quot;UnitedHealth is the best-run health insurer in America. I bet they can raise numbers,&quot; Cramer said. &quot;As for JNJ, it&#39;s been trading like it&#39;s got earnings risk, but they&#39;ve got the best pipeline in the business and that&#39;s what matters most. I hope it pulls back and you can get a chance to buy into further weakness.&quot;

Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley: Neither one of these investment banks is &quot;getting anywhere near the respect&quot; it deserves, Cramer said ahead of their earnings reports. He expected good results from both, but admitted he&#39;s miscalculated investment bank earnings in the past.

&quot;I honestly can&#39;t believe that Goldman Sachs, my alma mater, is the cheapest in the entire group. I do hope that David Solomon, the new CEO, ... sketches out a vision for how to restore growth, and that Stephen Scherr, the new CFO, is polished enough to paint a positive picture of falling expenses and rising revenue,&quot; Cramer said. &quot;This stock has sold off in the wake of its conference call for ages. Maybe the new team can break that pattern.&quot;

IBM: With shares of IBM hovering around their 52-week lows, Cramer hoped that even a modest quarterly report would help the stock recover.

&quot;To me, IBM doesn&#39;t seem to have much downside. It does sport a 4.5 percent yield here,&quot; he said. &quot;I just don&#39;t know if the company&#39;s gradual embrace of faster-growing, strategic-imperative businesses will produce blowout numbers, which is what this stock really needs. But this low, ... I think it&#39;s probably going to be OK no matter what.&quot;

Netflix: Streaming colossus Netflix will also issue its quarterly report, the first since the company&#39;s slowing subscriber growth disappointed investors in June.

&quot;Unless those numbers pick up from the last quarter, this stock&#39;s not going anywhere,&quot; Cramer warned. &quot;That said, Netflix is down more than $80 bucks from its highs, and it was down $100 yesterday. Long-term, this might be a good buying opportunity.&quot;
