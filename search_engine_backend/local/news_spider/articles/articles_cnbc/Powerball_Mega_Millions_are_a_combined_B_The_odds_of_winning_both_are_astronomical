Between the nation&#39;s two largest lotteries, there&#39;s nearly $1 billion in jackpot money up for grabs. The odds of hitting all winning numbers in either game? Pretty bad.

For the $654 million Mega Million jackpot — which marks the game&#39;s second-largest top prize ever — your chance of winning is 1 in 302.6 million. For Powerball&#39;s $345 million top prize, it&#39;s 1 in 292 million.

The chance of winning both is at least 1 in 88 quadrillion. That&#39;s 88 followed by 15 zeros.
