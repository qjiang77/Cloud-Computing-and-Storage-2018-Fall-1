The Italian government has defended its 2019 budget priorities after the European Commission sent a letter to Rome, arguing that the financial plans seems to point to a &quot;particularly serious non-compliance with the budgetary policy obligations laid down&quot; in European rules. Italy must reply to the European Commission by Monday.

Shares in Italian banks sank on the latest row between Rome and Brussels. Ubi Banca fell 2.75 percent and UniCredit dropped 0.96 percent over the day.

Italian stocks and bonds fought back from earlier in Friday afternoon trade however, after European Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs, Taxation and Customs, Pierre Moscovici, said he wanted to reduce tensions between Brussels and Rome.

European leaders and the British Prime Minister Theresa May said on Thursday that they are working hard to overcome the ongoing impasse in Brexit talks. However, May&#39;s idea to extend the transition process has sparked a wave of criticism back in London, where some lawmakers want to see a break-up from the EU as soon as possible.

On the data front, U.K. public sector net borrowing figures, excluding banks, was down 35 percent from April to September compared to a year ago.

In Asia, stocks were also mixed after China reported its growth rate for the third quarter of the year. The 6.5 percent year-on-year figure came in below expectations and is the weakest pace seen since the first quarter of 2009.
