Cramer Remix: Worrying about these stocks is a waste of time|http://www.cnbc.com/mad-money|http://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/02/cramer-remix-worrying-about-these-stocks-is-a-waste-of-time.html||2018-10-02|Elizabeth Gurdus,Ander Gillenea,Afp,Getty Images,David Paul Morris,Bloomberg,Cameron Costa||Investors are wasting their time if they&#39;re worried about the demise of off-price retailers like TJX Companies, Ross Stores and Burlington Stores, CNBC&#39;s Jim Cramer said Tuesday.

The &quot;Mad Money&quot; host&#39;s argument came on the heels of UBS&#39; research arm initiating coverage on a number of retail stocks. The lead analyst, Jay Sole, argued that off-price retailers could be pressured from not having enough of an online presence and predicted that they would hit their peak in North America by early 2021.

But &quot;so far, their lack of serious online exposure doesn&#39;t seem to be hurting them one bit and for now the treasure hunt experience is clearly drawing in a lot of customers,&quot; Cramer said.

&quot;At the same time, all three companies are a heck of a lot more profitable than they used to be and this is something Sole mostly seems to ignore,&quot; he added.

And even if Sole is right about the 2021 peak, that still gives TJX, Ross and Burlington two and a half years of growth, Cramer said.

&quot;Please don&#39;t sell a stock because of some theoretical long-term worry that might, maybe, could be play[ing] out over the next three years,&quot; he concluded. &quot;The stock market is a shorter-term beast — typically six to nine months — and for now, TJX, Ross and Burlington are doing very, very well. They&#39;ve run a lot, but I&#39;d be a buyer into any weakness here.&quot;
