PayPal will let customers deposit and withdraw cash at Walmart stores|http://www.cnbc.com/retail|http://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/11/paypal-will-let-customers-deposit-and-withdraw-cash-at-walmart-stores.html||2018-10-11|Robert Ferris,Lucas Jackson||Just in time for the holidays, PayPal will start offering deposit and withdrawal services at Walmart stores â€” for a fee.

This is the first time customers will be able to take cash out of their PayPal accounts in a brick-and-mortar store, the companies said Thursday. Customers already can load their PayPal accounts with cash at the stores. The service will cost $3 per use.

PayPal Cash Mastercard customers will also be able to access their cash balance using Walmart Service Desks, ATMs and cash registers for the same fee.

"Walmart is committed to expanding access to financial services products that are convenient, easy to use and available for everyday low prices," said Daniel Eckert, senior vice president of Walmart Services & Digital Acceleration.

Both companies expect to have the service in every Walmart store in the U.S. by early November.

Such services can attract customers who have limited or no banking services. Slightly more than a quarter of U.S. households fit into either category, according to a 2015 study by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.

Shares of PayPal were up 2.2 percent in early trading Thursday. Shares of Walmart were flat.
