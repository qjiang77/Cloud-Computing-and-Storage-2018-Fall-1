US producer prices rebound in September|http://www.cnbc.com/economy|http://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/10/us-producer-price-index-rose-0point2percent-in-sept-as-expected.html||2018-10-10|||September producer price index up 0.2% 9:01 AM ET Wed, 10 Oct 2018 | 04:23

U.S. producer prices increased 0.2 percent in September, reversing an unexpected decline in August and in line with expectations.

A rise in services prices offset a slight drop in prices for goods. Final demand prices had fallen 0.1 percent in August. In the 12 months through September, the producer price index rose 2.6 percent, slightly less than expected.

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the PPI increasing 0.2 percent in September and advancing 2.8 percent year-on-year.

A key gauge of underlying producer price pressures that excludes food, energy and trade services rose 0.4 percent last month, the largest increase since January. The so-called core PPI had risen 0.1 percent in August.

In the 12 months through September, the core PPI rose 2.9 percent, the same as the month before.
