GM tops Tesla in ranking of automated driving systems|http://www.cnbc.com/phil-lebeau|http://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/03/gm-tops-tesla-in-ranking-of-automated-driving-systems.html||2018-10-03|Phil Lebeau,Source,General Motors||As more automakers develop automated driving systems that allow drivers to take their hands off the steering wheels for short periods of time, a new report says General Motors has developed the best system.



Consumer Reports tested four of the most popular systems and says Cadillac&#39;s Super Cruise does the best job of ensuring the vehicle is driven safely while making sure drivers pay attention when they take their hands off the steering wheels.

&quot;Super Cruise has a camera that looks at the drivers&#39; eyes and warns them if they look away for too long or fall asleep, and that&#39;s a game changer,&quot; said Jake Fisher, director of auto testing at Consumer Reports.

&quot;This is definitely a shot across the bow of Tesla, which already has Autopilot,&quot; said Michelle Krebs, analyst for AutoTrader said.

Consumer Reports ranks Tesla&#39;s Autopilot as the second-most effective automated driving system, criticizing it for not doing enough to keep the driver engaged when the vehicle is in Autopilot mode.

&quot;Autopilot is a strong system, but it doesn&#39;t have enough safeguards,&quot; said Fisher.
