T-Mobile to power US headquarters with renewable energy|http://www.cnbc.com/world|http://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/17/t-mobile-to-power-us-headquarters-with-renewable-energy.html||2018-10-17|Anmar Frangoul,Michael Loccisano,Getty Images Entertainment,Getty Images||T-Mobile U.S. has taken another step to green its operations.



In an announcement Tuesday, the firm said it had joined Puget Sound Energy&#39;s Green Direct program, which gives it access to a combination of local wind and solar power.



This mix will be used to power its headquarters in Bellevue, Washington, with 100 percent renewable energy by the year 2021.



T-Mobile said the new arrangement would help it to save &quot;millions of dollars in energy costs&quot; and put it a step closer to its overarching goal of using 100 percent renewable energy across the whole company by 2021.



&quot;We&#39;ve put a stake in the ground to go 100 percent renewable by 2021 -- because it&#39;s the right thing to do and it&#39;s smart business,&quot; CEO John Legere said in a statement Tuesday.



Legere added that T-Mobile was choosing green power &quot;because it makes sense for the planet and for our customers.&quot;



T-Mobile is a member of the RE100, a global initiative made up of major businesses, all committed to renewable power. Other members of the RE100 include Facebook, Goldman Sachs and Microsoft.
