The firm bumped CarMax to the number one spot on its rankings of U.S. auto dealers and reiterated its overweight rating for CarMax stock.

"We see [CarMax] as a best in class operator with an opportunity to grow market share," Armintas Sinkevicius said in a note to clients Wednesday. The analyst also said the company's upcoming results will compare more favorably to prior quarters.
