This sector could be the best bet this year|http://www.cnbc.com/keris-lahiff|http://finance.yahoo.com/blogs/talking-numbers/this-sector-could-be-the-best-bet-this-year-221356847.html||2015-03-05|Lawrence Lewitinn||Is the best-performing sector so far in 2015 also the best bet for the rest of the year?

The ETF tracking the S&P 500’s health-care sector (trading under the symbol XLV) is up 6 percent year to date. That easily trounces the returns for the index as a whole, which is currently at around 2 percent.

One portfolio advisor expects health care to remain the best sector for the balance of 2015 for several reasons.

“Health care has the highest earnings out of all the sectors in the S&P 500—about 13 percent growth while the index only has 3 percent growth,” said Erin Gibbs, equity chief investment officer at S&P Capital IQ Global Market Intelligence. “We are looking at over four times the rate of growth. It’s also one of only two sectors with double-digits growth.”

The health-care sector’s valuation is more attractive than the rest of the S&P 500, said Gibbs, noting that the XLV trades at 18.4 times estimated forward earnings versus 17.7 times for the index. “You get only a 4 percent premium on valuations for four times as much growth,” said Gibbs, who has more than $15 billion in assets under advisory. “Not a bad trade-off.”

Gibbs also sees a macro reason for the health-care sector to be a buy—aging baby boomers. “Health care is becoming a larger part of our overall economy,” she said, adding that biotechnology and health-care technology are two of the fastest growers in the sector.

The technicals are also bullish on health care, based on the chart work of Todd Gordon, founder of TradingAnalysis.com. He has even added to his position in the XLV via options.

“This is the strongest sector,” he said. “I’m going to continue to stay long.”

Gordon’s chart shows the XLV recently breaking above a consolidation range that has been in place over the past few months. However, it broke above the top of that range at around $71.50 per share and is now in an uptrend channel.

“I am looking for an upside move along that parallel channel up to about the $75 to $77 area just in the next couple of months,” said Gordon, a CNBC contributor.

The XLV closed at $72.84 per share on Thursday.
