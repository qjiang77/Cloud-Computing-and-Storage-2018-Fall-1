'Wild swings' likely to rock US stocks in coming weeks: Wells Fargo|http://www.cnbc.com/futures-now|http://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/15/wild-swings-likely-to-rock-us-stocks-in-coming-weeks-wells-fargo.html||2018-08-15|Stephanie Landsman,Daniel Acker,Bloomberg,Getty Images,Susana Vera,Drew Angerer,David A. Grogan||Wells Fargo Securities has a new message for investors: Hold on tight.

Christopher Harvey, the firm&#39;s head of equity strategy, believes the Turkey debt crisis will spark a crisis of confidence in the United States as earnings season winds down, and headline risks become front and center again.

&quot;You can start to have a lot more wild swings in the marketplace,&quot; he said Tuesday on CNBC&#39;s &quot;Futures Now.&quot; &quot;What we&#39;re telling clients is &#39;don&#39;t light your hair on fire. Start to take down risk prudently, and selectively.&quot;

But make no mistake, Harvey isn&#39;t turning bearish. It&#39;s the potential for stomach-churning waves of volatility, that could throw investors, he said. It&#39;s not the actual dip.

&quot;We don&#39;t think we&#39;ll see much of a sell-off. If we do see a sell-off, we think it&#39;s in or around 2 to 3 percent,&quot; said Harvey, who&#39;s maintaining his S&P 500 year-end price target of 2,950. It would be a gain of about 4 percent from current levels.

&quot;We are still constructive on the market, but we think people need to be a lot more selective today than they have been in the past,&quot; he said.

To ride out the volatility, Harvey is telling clients to reduce exposure to technology and other momentum areas of the market. He contends they could get hurt the most.

&quot;It&#39;s going to be painful, but it will be healthy. The market will be more discriminating as we move forward,&quot; Harvey said. &quot;Start cycling into more defensive equities: your staples, your utilities, your REITs, more of your bond proxies at the margin.&quot;
