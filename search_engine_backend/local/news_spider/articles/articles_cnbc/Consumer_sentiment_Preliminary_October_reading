Consumer sentiment: Preliminary October reading|http://www.cnbc.com/economy|http://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/12/preliminary-october-consumer-sentiment-at-99-vs-100-reading-expected.html||2018-10-12|Michael Sheetz||A survey of consumer sentiment in October fell just short of expectations on Friday but found American confidence in U.S. economic policy was at a 15-year high.

The University of Michigan&#39;s monthly survey of consumers hit 99 in its preliminary reading for October, below the 100.4 expected from economists polled by Reuters. The index remained just below September&#39;s reading of 100.1.

&quot;Consumer sentiment slipped in early October, although it remained at quite favorable levels and just above the average reading during 2018,&quot; Richard Curtin, chief economist for the survey, said in a statement.

Within the survey, a key data point revealed growing bipartisan support for the government&#39;s economic policies.

&quot;Confidence in the government&#39;s economic policies rose in October to its highest level in the past fifteen years (see the chart), reflecting the strong performance of the national economy,&quot; Curtin said. &quot;Most of the October gain was due to an upward adjustment by Democrats, although their evaluations were still well below the much more favorable evaluations of Republicans.&quot;

The overall index has slumped since March when it reached its highest level since 2004 with a reading of 101.4.

The survey considers 500 consumers&#39; outlook on economic prospects, accounting for sentiment on personal finances, inflation, unemployment, government policies and interest rates.
