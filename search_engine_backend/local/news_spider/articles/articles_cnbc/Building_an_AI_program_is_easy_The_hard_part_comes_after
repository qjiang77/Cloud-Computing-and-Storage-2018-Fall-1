Building an A.I. program is easy. The hard part comes after|http://www.cnbc.com/world|http://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/08/building-an-ai-program-is-easy-the-hard-part-comes-after.html||2018-06-08|Saheli Roy Choudhury,Krisztian Bocsi,Bloomberg,Getty Images||&quot;I would argue that AI is overkill for the majority of use cases,&quot; Drew Perez, chief executive officer at Adatos, said during a panel discussion and added that the benefits of AI are not instantaneous in many cases. His start-up uses AI to study satellite and drone images of agricultural lands to assess things such as tree counts, soil conditions and plant health. &quot;At the end of the day, if you think about it, it has to have a return on investment.&quot;

Perez told an audience that, most AI programs today are in the &quot;lab phase or innovation phase.&quot; He explained that even if there are the right conditions — including having the right amount of computing power, sufficient data, the right mix of talent and a culture that readily embraces AI — profitability is not guaranteed.

&quot;You might go for a whole year and find out at the end that, for a million dollars, I&#39;m going to make a hundred thousand [dollars],&quot; he said, explaining that short-term plays in the stock market, for example, could likely give a better return on investment. Unless a company is able to figure out an application for their AI program that can bring in &quot;hundreds of millions, it&#39;s just a lab experiment,&quot; he said.

Monetizing an AI program is only a problem if it fails to address an important problem, according to Steve Leonard, founding chief executive officer at Singapore-based start-up accelerator SGInnovate.

&quot;Some people say, &#39;Oh, I&#39;m having a hard time monetizing.&#39; For me, the first question is what led you to work on that problem, so if you&#39;re having a hard time monetizing, it must mean that you didn&#39;t have a problem that was sufficiently painful for somebody to take an action,&quot; Leonard told CNBC.
