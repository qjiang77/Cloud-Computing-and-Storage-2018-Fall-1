US Treasury Sec Mnuchin still plans to attend Saudi summit as Sen Rubio calls for boycott|http://www.cnbc.com|http://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/14/us-treasury-sec-mnuchin-still-plans-to-attend-saudi-summit.html||2018-10-14|Mike Blake||"If we do not take action, including potentially arms sales, as a result of this, if it turns out to be what they say it is, then we are not going to be able to with a straight face or any credibility confront Putin or Assad or Maduro in Venezuela or frankly confront the Chinese and their human rights violations," Rubio said on Sunday in an interview with CBS's Face the Nation.

Khashoggi went missing after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey, on Oct 2. to retrieve documents for his forthcoming marriage. Turkish officials and his fiancee said he never came out.

Turkish sources have said they believe Khashoggi was killed inside the building and his body removed, allegations that Riyadh dismisses as baseless.

U.S. President Donald Trump vowed to get to the bottom of what happened in a separate CBS interview, due to be aired Sunday, and said there would be "severe punishment" if it were found Khashoggi was killed by the Saudi government.

But Trump also told reporters on Saturday that the United States must balance the economic benefit gained from an ongoing $110 billion arms deal with the Saudi military when planning a response.
