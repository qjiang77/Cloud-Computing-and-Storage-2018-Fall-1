Multimillion-dollar WWE pay-per-view deal in jeopardy due to Saudi Arabia tensions|http://www.cnbc.com/world|http://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/12/multi-million-dollar-wwe-pay-per-view-deal-in-jeopardy-due-to-saudi-arabia-tensions.html||2018-10-12|Adam Reed,Ethan Miller,Getty Images Entertainment,Getty Images||WWE is due to return to Saudi Arabia on November 2 for its "Crown Jewel" night of wrestling, but now it is unclear if the event at the King Saud University Stadium in Riyadh will go ahead.

A representative for WWE released a statement to the media saying, "We are currently monitoring the situation."

WWE has already taken its travelling show to Saudi Arabia once this year when it sold out the 60,000 capacity King Abdullah International Stadium in Jeddah for the "Greatest Royal Rumble." This proposed show would be the second event as part of a long-term partnership between WWE and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

Several of the organizations most famous superstars are due to appear on the bill. Including, for the first time since 2010, WWE Hall of Famer Shawn Michaels, who it was revealed last week would be returning to the ring alongside Triple H, real name Paul Levesque.

"Crown Jewel" is due to stream live on the organization's own WWE Network and be available on pay-per-view services outside of the Middle East.
