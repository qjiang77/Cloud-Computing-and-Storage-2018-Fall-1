What you can learn from Sheryl Sandberg's plans to donate her SurveyMonkey shares|http://www.cnbc.com/lorie-konish|http://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/04/sheryl-sandberg-used-this-strategy-to-donate-surveymonkey-shares.html||2018-10-04|Lorie Konish,Getty Images,-David Karp,Co-Founder Of Pagnatokarp||Sandberg&#39;s late husband, Dave Goldberg, was the CEO of SurveyMonkey.

SurveyMonkey&#39;s prospectus lists Sandberg&#39;s ownership of the company through a revocable trust as 10.3 million shares, or 8.4 percent of the company after the offering.

Sandberg&#39;s charitable plans are part of her plans to participate in the Giving Pledge, whereby some of the world&#39;s wealthiest individuals, including Warren Buffett and Bill Gates, have agreed to give most of their wealth to charity.

Sandberg has previously donated Facebook shares to charity through a donor-advised fund, according to public filings.

The SurveyMonkey donation is in keeping with the spirit of what Sandberg has written and shared following her husband&#39;s death, said Charlie Douglas, an estate-planning expert who runs a family office.

That includes the one-line prayer a childhood friend shared with Sandberg in the wake of Goldberg&#39;s death: &quot;Let me not die while I am still alive.&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s a joy in giving during life that you&#39;re obviously not going to experience if you wait to give it away when you die,&quot; Douglas said.

The strategy that Sandberg is using is one that all investors can learn from, according to experts in charitable giving.

&quot;Giving appreciated investments to charity is a very, very smart strategy,&quot; said Kim Laughton, president of Schwab Charitable.

But there are a few things to think about before you take a cue from Sandberg.
