Stella & Dot CEO: Here's what to say when a guy is mansplaining you|http://www.cnbc.com/netnet|http://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/09/stella--dot-ceo-heres-what-to-say-when-a-guy-is-mansplaining-you.html||2018-10-09|Adam Bryant,Marla Aufmuth,Getty Images Entertainment,Getty Images,Ari Perilstein||Here&#39;s another short script that Herrin suggests women can use in these one-on-one discussions: &quot;You talked over me, and it made me feel bad and undervalued. What would be more productive for me is if we got to share the air. How about next time you let me lead? Wouldn&#39;t this company be more productive if everybody got to speak at the meeting, and wouldn&#39;t you be a hero for being a person who showed that you were a leader who let other people be heard?&quot;

Granted, you never know how the man might react to that conversation, but women shouldn&#39;t shy away from those difficult moments, Herrin said.

&quot;Confrontation is not a bad thing when it comes to direct communication with candor,&quot; she added. &quot;You can be candid and kind at the same time. And to advance women in the workplace, women have to recognize that there should be nothing controversial or negative with directly communicating and giving real-time feedback on how productive a meeting was.&quot;

&quot;And if you can share how you feel so that you&#39;re speaking from a place of inarguable truth rather than accusation, the other person&#39;s going to be a lot more open-minded. They&#39;re going to respect you.&quot;
