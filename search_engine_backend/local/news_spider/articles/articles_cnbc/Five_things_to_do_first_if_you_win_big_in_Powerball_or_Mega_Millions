Five things to do first if you win big in Powerball or Mega Millions|http://www.cnbc.com|http://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/11/five-things-to-do-first-if-you-win-big-in-powerball-or-mega-millions.html||2018-10-11|Sarah O'Brien,Brendan Mcdermid||The standard advice from experts is to sign the back of the winning ticket so that if you are separated from it, your signature can help ensure you still get the prize.

However, signing it could interfere with your ability to shield your identity from the public, depending on where you bought it. A handful of states states let you claim anonymously, while others require the winner's name to be announced. Still, others will allow a trust or other legal entity to claim the prize on your behalf, thereby keeping your name out of the public eye.

This illustrates why you should contact an experienced attorney before doing much of anything. And make sure you put the original winning ticket in a safe place.
