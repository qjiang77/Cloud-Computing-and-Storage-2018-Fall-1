Elon Musk believes Tesla is &quot;very close&quot; to turning a profit after years of burning through cash, but warned that Sunday would prove pivotal to the car marker achieving an &quot;epic victory&quot; on its production goals.

On the heels of a turbulent last few weeks that culminated in Tesla reaching a settlement with securities regulators, the company is expected to report third quarter production numbers this week.

In two emails obtained by CNBC, Musk exhorted staffers to &quot;ignore the distractions&quot; and that the company was close to &quot;proving naysayers wrong.&quot; With Sunday being the end of the quarter, Musk said that Tesla must go &quot;all out&quot; on production in order to &quot;achieve a victory beyond all expectations.&quot;

A report in Electrek suggested Tesla has already met an ambitious benchmark for its Model 3, after setting a production record in the second quarter. The publication reported that Tesla has already broken its record ahead of the third quarter&#39;s close, suggesting it would exceed guidance of 50,000 - 55,000 Model 3s.
