A deluge of rebalancing should drive investor money toward household names like Verizon, Alphabet, The Walt Disney Company and Electronic Arts, according to J.P. Morgan equity strategist Dubravko Lakos-Bujas.

"The key change is the reclassification of Telecom Services as Communication Services sector," Lakos-Bujas wrote Monday. "Sector reclassification on its own can trigger significant rebalancing in quant portfolios even if the stocks' fundamentals are unchanged."
