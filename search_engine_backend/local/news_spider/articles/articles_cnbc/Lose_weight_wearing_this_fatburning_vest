Lose weight wearing this fat-burning vest|http://www.cnbc.com/erin-barry|http://www.cnbc.com/2016/10/12/lose-weight-wearing-this-fat-burning-vest.html||2016-10-12|Crystal Rivera,Source,Thin Ice||Paulin, a former personal trainer, told CNBC that his clients found it difficult to adhere to a diet or exercise program. He wanted a solution "for people to burn calories without the need for substantial behavioral change."

So in April 2015 Paulin launched Thin Ice, a wearable weight-loss line that claims to boost users' metabolisms literally without moving a muscle.

The start-up's premiere product, the Thin Ice vest, uses cold therapy to target areas of the body with high concentrations of thermoreceptors, which are nerve cells that are able to detect the presence of hot or cold temperatures. When they're cold enough, fat-burning processes are triggered.

"Thin Ice stimulates your body with cold temperatures, forcing your body to produce extra heat and burn calories in the process," said Paulin.

According to research by the International Journal of Obesity, a cold body's thermoreceptors activate Brown adipose tissue (BAT), known as "good fat," which in turn burns white fat, "bad fat," to produce heat.

"This metabolic boost can be taken advantage of even while lounging around," said Paulin.

The start-up's vest is controlled via the Thin Ice smartphone app, where users can adjust temperatures, track estimated calories burned and set weight-loss goals.

According to the start-up, users burn between 500 and 1,000 calories a day wearing the Thin Ice vest, however at this time there are no studies to prove the vest's effectiveness.

Thin Ice vests are currently available for pre-order on the company's Indiegogo page for $169.

Since its launch, the start-up has pre-sold 5,000 units, set for delivery in December.
