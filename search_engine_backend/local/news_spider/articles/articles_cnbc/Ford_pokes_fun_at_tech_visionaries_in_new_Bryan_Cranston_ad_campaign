&quot;Breaking Bad&quot; star Bryan Cranston anchors the new &quot;Built Ford Proud&quot; ad campaign that kicks off with a series of television commercials set to air during college football games this weekend.

&quot;Talk doesn&#39;t get things done, building does ... like we have for the last 115 years,&quot; Cranston says against a variety of scenes that poke fun at today&#39;s high-tech visionaries while touching on the company&#39;s historical American roots and &quot;Built Ford Tough&quot; slogan of past campaigns. &quot;Let the other guys keep dreaming about the future. We&#39;ll be the ones building it.&quot;
