EU teams up with Bill Gates to launch $115.2 million clean energy investment fund|http://www.cnbc.com|http://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/18/european-commission-launches-clean-energy-investment-fund.html||2018-10-18|Anmar Frangoul,Charly Triballeau,Afp,Getty Images||The European Commission has signed a memorandum of understanding with the Bill Gates-led Breakthrough Energy to set up a joint investment fund called Breakthrough Energy Europe (BEE).



In a statement Wednesday, the Commission said the 100 million-euro ($115.2 million) fund would be used to help &quot;innovative European companies develop and bring radically new clean energy technologies to the market.&quot;



Breakthrough Energy Ventures is an investor-led fund with over $1 billion in committed capital to build &quot;cutting edge companies&quot; to help stop climate change. Its chairman is Bill Gates.



In a statement Wednesday, Gates said that new technologies were needed to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. Europe, Gates added, had demonstrated valuable leadership by making &quot;impressive&quot; investments in research and development.



&quot;The scientists and entrepreneurs who are developing innovations to address climate change need capital to build companies that can deliver those innovations to the global market,&quot; he said. &quot;Breakthrough Energy Europe is designed to provide that capital.&quot;



The Commission said the new fund would focus on cutting greenhouse gas emissions and the promotion of energy efficiency in &quot;the areas of electricity, transport, agriculture, manufacturing, and buildings.&quot; It described BEE as a pilot project that could act as a model for similar initiatives in other thematic areas.



The Commission&#39;s president, Jean-Claude Juncker, said that pooling public and private investment in new and innovative clean energy technology was &quot;key to enabling long-term solutions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. If Europe is to have a future that can guarantee the well-being of all its citizens, it will need to be climate-friendly and sustainable.&quot;
