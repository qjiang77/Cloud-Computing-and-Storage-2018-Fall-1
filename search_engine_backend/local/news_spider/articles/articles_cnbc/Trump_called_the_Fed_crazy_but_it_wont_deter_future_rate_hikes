Trump called the Fed 'crazy,' but it won't deter future rate hikes|http://www.cnbc.com/futures-now|http://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/14/trump-called-the-fed-crazy-but-it-wont-deter-future-rate-hikes.html||2018-10-14|Keris Lahiff,Daniel Acker,Bloomberg,Getty Images,Susana Vera,Drew Angerer,David A. Grogan||President Donald Trump has gone on the attack against the Federal Reserve, but it&#39;s highly unlikely the Fed will listen, at least one market observer says.

Last week, Trump amped up his criticism of the Fed by calling its decision to hike rates &quot;crazy&quot; and &quot;out of control.&quot; Markets are pricing in another increase in December, in what would be the ninth increase of a tightening cycle that began in late 2015. Still, the fed funds rate remains near historical lows.

&quot;Loco, crazy, fake, whatever you want to call it, I think that has zero impact on the Fed,&quot; said Michael Schumacher, head of interest rate strategy at Wells Fargo, on CNBC&#39;s &quot;Futures Now&quot; Thursday.

While the Fed&#39;s criticism is unlikely to deter the central bank, Schumacher said at least one thing could change members&#39; minds.

&quot;What could impact the Fed, though, is if you see equities take another downturn from here,&quot; he explained. The fear of higher rates has shaken investors, who sent blue chip and technology shares on a wild, volatile ride last week.

&quot;Stocks are really not down very much. Dropping 3 percent in a day, yes it&#39;s a big deal, [but] is that really going to steer the Fed? No,&quot; Schumacher said. &quot;But if they were down 10 to 15 percent in a week, maybe that could.&quot;

The S&P 500 has not dropped by more than 10 percent in one week since it plummeted 18 percent in October 2008, and a 6 percent decline in March was its biggest weekly drop this year. Even last week, one of the most whipsaw of 2018, ended with just a 4.1 percent fall.

Stock market pressure would likely continue as rising yields continue to spook investors, Schumacher said.

&quot;The combination of tariffs, more debt issuance by the Treasury, and general concern on the inflation front, I suspect is getting people a little bit more worried about prospects down the road,&quot; the analyst said. &quot;I suspect that&#39;s why corporate America is more concerned now than it was a few months ago.&quot;

Higher rates make debt for highly-leveraged companies more expensive. Last week, the 10-year yield spiking to its highest level since 2011 sent stock markets sharply lower on Wednesday and Thursday.

Schumacher anticipates a modest increase in the 10-year yield to 3.35 percent by year&#39;s end, but he notes that a few market factors could increase his forecast.

&quot;You could imagine a number of scenarios where that gets more severe â€“ if you do get a burst in inflation, if you get lots more Treasury issuance or something really gets derailed, could they get to 3.60 percent, 3.70 percent? It&#39;s possibly, we think unlikely, but it could happen,&quot; he said.

The 10-year yield last traded above 3.60 percent in February 2011.
