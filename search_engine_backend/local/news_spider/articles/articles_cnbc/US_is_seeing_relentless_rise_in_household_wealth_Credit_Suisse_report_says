US is seeing 'relentless rise in household wealth,' Credit Suisse report says|http://www.cnbc.com/editors-picks|http://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/18/credit-suisse-wealth-report-show-relentless-rise-in-household-wealth.html||2018-10-18|Holly Ellyatt,Alexander Spatari,Getty Images||Household wealth in the U.S. is continuing to see an &quot;unbroken spell of wealth gains&quot; but China has replaced Japan in second place in the world wealth hierarchy, according to Credit Suisse&#39;s latest report on global wealth.

During the 12 months since the bank&#39;s last report to mid-2018, aggregate global wealth rose by $14 trillion to $317 trillion, representing a growth rate of approximately 4.6 percent, according to the Global Wealth Report 2018, published by Credit Suisse&#39;s Research Institute on Thursday.

This growth rate was lower than last year, but higher than the average growth rate in the post-2008 era, the report noted.

&quot;The United States continued its unbroken spell of wealth gains since the global financial crisis, adding another $6 trillion to the stock of global wealth,&quot; Credit Suisse&#39;s annual report noted, saying that rising household wealth in the U.S. was &quot;seemingly relentless.&quot;
