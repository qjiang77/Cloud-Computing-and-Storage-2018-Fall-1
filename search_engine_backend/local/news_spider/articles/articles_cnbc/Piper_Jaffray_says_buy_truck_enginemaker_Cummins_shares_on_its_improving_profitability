The firm raised its rating to overweight from neutral for Cummins shares, predicting rising profitability for the company next year.

"We think consensus already captures a coming peak in Class 8 [heavy classification] truck demand, but fails to reflect margin expansion due to a mix-shift toward off-highway products," analyst Alexander Potter said in a note to clients Thursday. "The fading impact of warranty charges are also a tailwind."
