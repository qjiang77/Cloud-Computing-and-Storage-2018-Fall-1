Homeowners to start tapping $14.4 trillion in equity, research says|http://www.cnbc.com|http://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/19/homeowners-to-start-tapping-14point4-trillion-in-equity-research-says.html||2018-10-19|Sarah O'Brien,Hero Images,Getty Images||With untapped home equity at an all-time high of $14.4 trillion, homeowners could be poised to start cashing in, new research suggests.

Home equity — the difference between a property&#39;s value and the amount owed on it — is about $1 trillion higher than its peak in 2005 before the Great Recession, according to a TransUnion study released this week. By 2009, the level had dropped to about $6 trillion as the housing market struggled to recover.

&quot;Consumers have been building up that equity over the last seven years or so,&quot; said Joe Mellman, senior vice president and mortgage business leader at TransUnion. &quot;It has really come roaring back.&quot;
