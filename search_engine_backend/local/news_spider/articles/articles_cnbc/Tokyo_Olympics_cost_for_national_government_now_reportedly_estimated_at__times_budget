Tokyo Olympics cost for national government now reportedly estimated at 7 times budget|http://www.cnbc.com/yen-nee-lee|http://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/05/2020-tokyo-olympics-estimated-to-cost-7-times-over-budget-report.html||2018-10-05|Yen Nee Lee,Getty Images||The 2020 Olympics and Paralympics — to be held in Tokyo, Japan — are estimated to cost the national government seven times more than what was originally budgeted, Japanese newspaper The Mainichi reported on Friday.

Hosting the mega-events would cost Japan's national government 801.1 billion yen ($7.03 billion), the report said, citing the country's Board of Audit. That's the agency that reviews government expenditure.

Japan, the world's third-largest economy, had earlier estimated that the games would cost the central authority around 112.7 billion yen, according to the report.

Hosting the Olympics has become an expensive venture, and a number of past hosts — Brazil's Rio de Janeiro and Russia's Sochi, for example — went into debt after overshooting their budgets.
