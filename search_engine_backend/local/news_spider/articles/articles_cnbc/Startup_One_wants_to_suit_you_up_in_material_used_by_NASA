Start-up 13-One wants to suit you up in material used by NASA|http://www.cnbc.com/erin-barry|http://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/16/start-up-13-one-wants-to-suit-you-up-in-material-used-by-nasa.html||2018-02-16|Louise Connelly||A new start-up is making jackets out of the material used in spacesuits.

The start-up, called 13-One, has jackets lined with a radiant barrier developed by NASA scientists to protect astronauts from extreme temperatures. The technology provides a light-weight, reflective insulation that's capable of retaining 90 percent of one's body heat.

"This is a technology that was used in space and is still being used in space," says Hema Nambiar, founder and CEO of 13-One. "Now it's for everyday use."
