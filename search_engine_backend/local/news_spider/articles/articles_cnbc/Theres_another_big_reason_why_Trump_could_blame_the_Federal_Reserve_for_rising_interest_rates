There's another big reason why Trump could blame the Federal Reserve for rising interest rates|http://www.cnbc.com/world|http://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/12/one-big-reason-why-trump-can-blame-the-fed-for-rising-interest-rates.html||2018-10-12|Patti Domm,Getty Images||"Investors are starting to realize just how many bonds are coming at us in the year and two ahead. And I've talked about this repeatedly over the last couple of years. We had a budget deficit in the United States that went up from around $600 billion a couple of years ago to now the official number for fiscal '18 in now over $900 billion. But that doesn't really capture how much debt is really being added to the national debt in the United States," said Jeff Gundlach, DoubleLine CEO on CNBC.

Gundlach said there is also a loan to the Social Security system that takes the figure to $1.27 trillion. There are also pension liabilities and veterans benefits.

"On top of that you have the Fed now cranking up quantitative easing to $50 billion a month, which is another $600 billion for fiscal 2019 if they continue on that course. Which takes you to around $2.25 trillion of debt increase. And this is at a time where we're supposedly in a good economy," he said. The Fed's $50 billion a month reduction includes both Treasurys and mortgages.

In an effort to help the economy and add liquidity to markets, the Fed loaded up on those securities during the financial crisis, in a then-controversial program, known as quantitative easing, or QE. The Fed's balance sheet reached a whopping $4.5 trillion by late 2014, when former Fed Chair Janet Yellen announced an end to the program.

"Most people don't understand the balance sheet because it's never happened before. Equities went up because of the quantitative easing...Now they're selling those assets, what do you think is going to happen now?" said Andrew Brenner of National Alliance.
