It was a return to (relative) stability for stocks this week after losses that hit 4% the week prior, suggesting the rout might be over, though stocks are still about 5% off September&#39;s all-time highs. Now earnings season gets a little meatier: A third of the Dow index and 30% of the S&P 500 reports in the coming week, and particular emphasis will be on bellwethers of the tech rally: Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are all reporting, and with typical volatility out of earnings, that likely means tens of billions in overall market cap swings ahead. Meanwhile, key housing numbers arrive against the backdrop of a market legging down (amid cramped supply) and more borrowing rate hikes likely ahead; September&#39;s new home sales report comes on Oct. 24, alongside the August FHFA Housing Price Index, while September pending home sales come Oct. 25.
