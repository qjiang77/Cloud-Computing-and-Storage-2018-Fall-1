Sky advises shareholders to accept Comcast offer 'immediately'|http://www.cnbc.com/alex-sherman|http://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/24/sky-to-accept-comcast-offer-immediately.html||2018-09-24|Spriha Srivastava,Charles Mostoller,Bloomberg,Getty Images,Chris Ratcliffe||U.K. broadcaster Sky recommended on Monday that its shareholders accept a $40 billion takeover offer from Comcast.

&quot;As the price of the Comcast Offer is materially superior, it is in the best interests of all Sky shareholders to accept the Comcast Offer,&quot; the company said.

&quot;Accordingly, the Independent Committee unanimously recommends that Sky shareholders accept the Comcast Offer, and in order to ensure the successful closing of the Comcast Offer, and given the possibility of a delisting of Sky in the near future, urges shareholders to accept immediately.&quot;

Now it&#39;s down to Sky&#39;s board and shareholders to accept either offer by Oct. 11.

Comcast has to secure 50 percent acceptance for the deal to go through. Since Fox already owns 39 percent of Sky, it means Comcast is looking for 50 percent of the remaining 61 percent acceptance — so that&#39;s more than 80 percent acceptance of the board.

Shares in Sky jumped 9 percent to £17.22 in early trade on Monday, just below the 17.28 pounds a share bid by Comcast bid.

Comcast outflanked rival Twenty-First Century Fox with its $40 billion takeover offer on Saturday in a rare three-round auction that pitted two of America&#39;s largest media companies against one another.
