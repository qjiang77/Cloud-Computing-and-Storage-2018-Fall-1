There's more pain to come for stocks, according to analysts watching the charts|http://www.cnbc.com/patti-domm|http://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/10/technical-analysts-theres-more-pain-to-come-for-stocks.html||2018-10-10|Thomas Franck,Fred Imbert,Brendan Mcdermid,Scott Mlyn||"Until we see some stabilization in that basket, we will continue to see weakness," O'Hara said.

Netflix dropped more than 6 percent, while Amazon fell 3.3 percent on Wednesday. Facebook and Apple, meanwhile, pulled back at least 1.5 percent each.

Chipmaker stocks also fell sharply, with the VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) falling 2.7 percent, on pace for its fifth straight day of losses. Nvidia and Micron are both down at least 4 percent.

These declines pushed the S&P 500 below its 50-day moving average, a key technical level. Entering Wednesday's session, the index's 50-day moving average was around 2,880.

Andrew Thrasher, portfolio manager at The Financial Enhancement Group and founder of Thrasher Analytics, said the S&P 500 also breached its January highs.

"What's concerning is that we saw the index break below its January high with narrowing breadth and not getting a confirmation of the most recent high by several momentum gauges," Thrasher said. "To get back to being bullish in broad U.S. equities I want to see SPX recover that January high. If we see stocks continue to slide I'll be looking for the next level of support at 2,790 which is the pivot point resistance in March and June before the breakout higher in July."

October's declines come amid cautious trading on Wall Street on the heels of a spike in borrowing costs, which can dampen corporate profits and the economy.
