Rate jitters are temporary, and stocks will rebound: Federated|http://www.cnbc.com/futures-now|http://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/10/rate-jitters-are-temporary-and-stocks-will-rebound-federated.html||2018-10-10|Stephanie Landsman,Daniel Acker,Bloomberg,Getty Images,Susana Vera,Drew Angerer,David A. Grogan||Stocks to overcome rate surge jitters and rally to new highs, Federated’s chief market watcher says 5:10 PM ET Tue, 9 Oct 2018 | 02:31

Federated Investors&#39; top market watcher isn&#39;t worried the rate surge will permanently derail the historic stock market rally.

According to Phil Orlando, the 10-Year Treasury note yield will retreat from seven-year highs in the coming days, and stocks will return to another record breaking leap higher.

&quot;We&#39;re not the least bit concerned with Treasury yields being at 3.25 percent,&quot; the firm&#39;s chief equity market strategist said Tuesday on CNBC&#39;s &quot;Futures Now.&quot; &quot;What the problem here is the speed — the rapidity — with which we&#39;ve gone there. We&#39;ve gone from 3.05 [percent] to 3.25 in a week, and that&#39;s very difficult for the market to be able to digest that in such a short amount of time.&quot;

He considers the move a knee-jerk reaction to the Federal Reserve&#39;s latest decision to raise rates by a quarter point.

&quot;The interest rates are higher because the economy is doing well, and the Fed is tightening policy,&quot; said Orlando. &quot;This is what&#39;s supposed to happen at this point in the economic cycle.&quot;

He maintains the S&P 500 will bounce about 7 percent by 2019, thus hitting his 3,100 price target. Yet, he&#39;s not eliminating the risk of a downturn, citing the stock market&#39;s strong double-digit percent returns since April.

&quot;We did expect a correction. We think that correction could be 5 percent or so,&quot; Orlando said. &quot;We&#39;re probably, you know, halfway through that at this point.&quot;

The S&P 500 is down about 1.5 percent in the past week. He contends it&#39;s an optimal buying opportunity, predicting that a strong earnings season and bullish GDP report will help pull stocks out of the doldrums in the coming weeks.

&quot;As we look at these catalysts over the next couple of weeks — a good earnings season and a good fourth quarter GDP report — I think we&#39;re going to end the year on a high note,&quot; he said, adding that energy, financials, industrials and small-cap stocks are his top picks right now.

Plus, Orlando doesn&#39;t see the gains slowing down as Well Street looks toward next year. For 2019, he has a 3,500 year-end target for the S&P — about a 20 percent jump from current levels.
