Cramer Remix: Investors should take a bite of this stock|http://www.cnbc.com/mad-money|http://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/15/cramer-remix-investors-should-take-a-bite-of-this-stock.html||2018-10-15|Elizabeth Gurdus,Daniel Acker,Bloomberg,Getty Images,Jonathan Alcorn,Adam Jeffery,Luke Sharrett||Marketwide stock declines may have investors questioning whether their stock picks are dropping for the right reasons, so on Monday, CNBC&#39;s Jim Cramer decided to pinpoint a winner on the decline: Yum Brands.

&quot;Honestly, the resilience of Yum has been kind of incredible,&quot; the &quot;Mad Money&quot; host said of the KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut parent. &quot;As tailwinds have turned into headwinds, the darned thing just keeps chugging, and I think last week&#39;s marketwide pullback has finally given you a nice little entry point in a stock that has been red-hot.&quot;

And with management now focusing on the company&#39;s almost entirely franchised business — a Cramer-fave model because of the lower risk and steadier revenue stream — Yum has transformed into one of the best restaurant chains Cramer follows, he told investors.

&quot;The bottom line? Yum&#39;s stock screamed higher as management made investors believe in their refranchising story, but then last week the whole market got slammed into a retaining wall [at] 60 miles an hour,&quot; he said.

&quot;I think you&#39;re getting a rare pullback in a stock that&#39;s been marching steadily higher for years,&quot; Cramer continued. &quot;I would be a buyer of this incredibly well-run company into any additional weakness.&quot;
