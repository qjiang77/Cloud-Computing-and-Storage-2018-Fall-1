Kamala Harris, Democrats push to repeal and replace Trump tax cuts|https://www.cnbc.com|https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/19/kamala-harris-democrats-push-to-repeal-and-replace-trump-tax-cuts.html||2018-10-19|Ylan Mui,Andrew Harrer,Bloomberg,Getty Images,David Paul Morris,-Rep. Ro Khanna||&quot;We&#39;ve seen the debate shift,&quot; Khanna said. &quot;My hope is that other presidential candidates will look at the Brown plan and embrace it as the alternative to Trump.&quot;

Ruben said his organization has spoken with other potential Democratic candidates about the idea but declined to specify whom. Earlier this year, Senate Democrats announced a more modest proposal to roll back the GOP tax cuts: Move the top tax rate for individuals back to 39 percent, raise the corporate tax rate 4 percentage points to 25 percent and reinstate the alternative minimum tax.

Rep. John Delaney, D-Md., who has announced he is running in 2020, has called for nudging the corporate tax rate up to 23 percent to pay for $1 trillion in infrastructure spending. He told CNBC he also supports expanding the earned income tax credit but did not say by how much.

&quot;We must reform our tax code in a way that is fiscally responsible, addresses our long-term economic competitiveness needs and helps working families,&quot; he said in a statement.

Indeed, the new tax credits come with a hefty price tag. Brown and Khanna&#39;s plan is expected to cost about $1.4 trillion â€“ just about what the Republican tax plan costs. Harris&#39; bill is likely to be in the same ballpark. That&#39;s why liberals say repealing the current law is a critical component of their plan.

Yet Democrats have repeatedly attacked the GOP tax cuts for ballooning the deficit. And while they argue that the new credits would support long-term economic growth, they are not claiming such a plan would pay for itself.
