PayPal surges 9% after its Venmo app shows signs of becoming a moneymaker|http://www.cnbc.com/technology|http://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/19/paypal-surges-9percent-after-solid-earnings-growth-in-venmo-showing-the-app-may-finally-become-a-money-maker.html||2018-10-19|Kate Rooney||PayPal shares soared 9 percent on Friday after the company beat expectations on earnings and revenue and announced positive news about its peer-to-peer app Venmo.

The payment company&#39;s stock hit a high above $86. Shares are up more than 26 percent year over year.

On Thursday, PayPal reported third-quarter earnings that beat Wall Street&#39;s expectations, though payment volumes fell slightly short of estimates. The company also raised its fourth-quarter and full-year guidance.

Venmo, which has struggled to contribute to PayPal&#39;s bottom line, had an especially bright third quarter. Its total payment volumes grew 78 percent, to $17 billion.

That still makes up a fraction of PayPal&#39;s total $143 billion in volume, but it&#39;s an encouraging sign, PayPal CEO Dan Schulman said on a call with analysts.

He pointed to some tangible growth in the social app&#39;s ability to make money. &quot;Our monetization efforts appear to be reaching a tipping point,&quot; Schulman said.

Twenty-four percent of Venmo users have now participated in what the CEO called a &quot;monetizable action&quot;â€” up from 17 percent in the second quarter and 13 percent in May. In September alone, PayPal said, it processed more than $1 billion in instant transfer volume on Venmo.
