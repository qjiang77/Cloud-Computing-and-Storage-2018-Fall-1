Cramer: Companies with China, Fed ties 'guilty until proven innocent'|http://www.cnbc.com|http://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/19/cramercompanies-with-china-fed-ties-guilty-until-proven-innocent.html||2018-10-19|Elizabeth Gurdus||3M: Tuesday morning marks &quot;the toughest couple of hours in earnings season,&quot; and Cramer is most worried about the report from 3M, the manufacturer of Scotch tape and a host of other consumer, industrial and health-related goods.

On Thursday, Cramer noted that he was considering trimming his charitable trust&#39;s position in 3M ahead of the quarter.

&quot;Unless the company announces some significant changes to its worldwide portfolio, I figure it&#39;s going to guide down again thanks to the weakness in autos,&quot; he said. &quot;It is a shame: 3M&#39;s stock is now down more than 60 points and it still hasn&#39;t been able to attract any substantial buyers.&quot;

Verizon: Cramer expected &quot;another stellar quarter&quot; from telecommunications giant Verizon.

&quot;It&#39;s funny, the stock&#39;s just a buck off its 52-week-high because the story is all domestic with tremendous strength in wireless and a good yield,&quot; he said. &quot;If Verizon comes in at all Monday, just go buy it, please.&quot;

United Technologies: The &quot;Mad Money&quot; host is still waiting for United Technologies to finalize its deal to buy Rockwell Collins, reiterating that &quot;the stock will indeed soar&quot; once the deal is closed.

The only thing missing is the Chinese government&#39;s approval, which has been &quot;elusive&quot; amid the United States and China&#39;s dispute over their trade relationship, Cramer said.

&quot;However, let me put a worrisome thought right into your head right now: Today Honeywell, which is further along in its restructuring, reported what I can only say was a monster good quarter, [...] but ... someone talked about tariffs on the call and then, boom, next thing you know, the stock is actually down,&quot; Cramer said.

&quot;It&#39;s mighty hard to trust the industrials because of China, and the Fed&#39;s not exactly making it easy, either,&quot; he continued. &quot;Since United Technologies has some housing exposure and some Chinese exposure, [I&#39;ll] pass.&quot;

Caterpillar: Another China-linked industrial, Caterpillar, will issue its earnings report.

&quot;Caterpillar should be terrific, but I doubt anyone will really care,&quot; Cramer said. &quot;Linked to China? Slowing. Linked to construction in this country? Slowing. Linked to mining? Eh.&quot;

McDonald&#39;s: McDonald&#39;s, however, could emulate Procter & Gamble&#39;s &quot;coiled spring&quot; effect when the fast-food chain&#39;s CEO, Steve Easterbrook, talks about a return to growth in the U.S. market, Cramer said.
