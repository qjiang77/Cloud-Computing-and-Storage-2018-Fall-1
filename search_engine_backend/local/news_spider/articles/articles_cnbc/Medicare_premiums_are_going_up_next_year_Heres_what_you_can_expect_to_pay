About 2 million Medicare beneficiaries — 3.5 percent — will pay less than the $135.50 premium for next year due to the &quot;hold harmless&quot; provision. That rule protects certain Social Security beneficiaries from paying more for their Part B premiums..

The annual deductible for Medicare Part B beneficiaries will be $185 in 2019, up from $183 in 2018.

Medicare Part B covers costs for services related to physicians, outpatient hospitals, home health, medical equipment and other care not covered by Medicare Part A.

The Medicare Part A inpatient deductible for hospital admittance will be $1,364 in 2019, up from $1,340 in 2018.

Medicare Part A covers inpatient and skilled nursing facility care, as well as some home health care services. Most Medicare beneficiaries — 99 percent — do not pay a premium for Medicare Part A, as long as they have at least 40 quarters of qualifying employment.

Annual Medicare open enrollment will run from Oct. 15 through Dec. 7 this year.
