A delegation from Saudi Arabia has now arrived in Turkey as part of a joint investigation into the disappearance. Khashoggi entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2 to get documents for his forthcoming marriage, but Turkish officials and his fiancee, who was waiting outside, said he never came out.
