Retiring near the beach may sound ideal, but there&#39;s more to consider than just sun and sand.

In fact, in a recent ranking of the best cities to retire, Pittsburgh claimed the top spot.

Although Pittsburgh scored poorly for weather, the metro area&#39;s low crime rate and cost of living helped pull it to the top. The former steel city turned tech powerhouse also boasts top-notch health care at the University of Pittsburgh.

To find the best places to retire, Bankrate.com assessed 50 U.S. metro areas, comparing factors including weather, health-care quality and affordability, cost of living, crime rate, taxes, senior well-being, friend factor (percentage of population ages 65-plus), cultural vitality and public transportation.

After working for decades, you may be tempted to find the most tropical, relaxing destination on the map. But it&#39;s important to look beyond climate to lifestyle and financial factors like health-care costs, which can be one of the biggest expenses for retirees, said Bankrate.com analyst Taylor Tepper.

&quot;It&#39;s like that saying, &#39;don&#39;t go into a grocery store hungry,&#39;&quot; Tepper said.
