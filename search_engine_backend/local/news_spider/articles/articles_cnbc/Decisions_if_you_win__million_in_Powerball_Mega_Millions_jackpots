The top prize for Mega Millions has reached $367 million and Powerball has climbed to $229 million.

If you're lucky enough to hit the jackpot in one of the next drawings — Tuesday night for Mega Millions and Wednesday night for Powerball — you should take a deep breath and resist the urge to tell the world about your exciting news, experts say.
