Russian woman charged with interference in 2018 midterms|http://www.cnbc.com/politics|http://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/19/woman-linked-to-russian-troll-farm-charged-with-interference-in-2018-midterms.html||2018-10-19|Dan Mangan,Sasha Mordovets,Getty Images||But the Justice Department said, &quot;The criminal complaint does not include any allegation that Khusyaynova or the broader conspiracy had any effect on the outcome of an election.&quot; The department said it received &quot;exceptional cooperation&quot; in its probe from Facebook, Twitter and other &quot;private sector companies.&quot;

Prosecutors claim Khusyaynova, who is not in custody, is the chief accountant for a Russian entity dubbed Project Lakhta, and managed the group&#39;s financing.

That group is backed by a Russian oligarch Yevgeniy Viktorovich Prigozhin, and two companies that he controls, Concord Management and Consulting LLC, and Concord Catering, according to prosecutors. The Concord firms were named in a criminal indictment brought by special counsel Robert Mueller that alleged attempted interference in the 2016 presidential election.

Prigozhin has been called &quot;Putin&#39;s chef,&quot; a reference to Russian leader Vladimir Putin.

The case against Khusyaynova is not being brought by Mueller. Instead, she is being prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney&#39;s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia.

The conspiracy tried to &quot;inflame passions on a variety of topics,&quot; including &quot;immigration, gun control and the Second Amendment, the Confederate flag, race relations, LGBT issues, the Women&#39;s March, and the NFL national anthem debate,&quot; according to a complaint against her. That complaint included images of various images, or &quot;memes,&quot; the conspiracy used as part of that effort.
