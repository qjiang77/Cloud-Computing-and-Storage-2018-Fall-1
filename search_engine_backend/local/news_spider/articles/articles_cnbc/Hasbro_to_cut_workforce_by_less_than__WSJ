Hasbro to cut workforce by less than 10%: WSJ|https://www.cnbc.com|https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/19/hasbro-to-cut-workforce-by-less-than-10percent-wsj.html||2018-10-19|Sarah Whitten,Michael Springer,Bloomberg,Getty Images||Toy maker Hasbro is expected to cut jobs as the toy industry continues to deal with the fallout from the bankruptcy of retailer Toys R Us, according to the Wall Street Journal.

The company said Thursday that it would be trimming less than 10 percent of its workforce as part of &quot;meaningful organizational changes&quot; to continue its &quot;ongoing transformation.&quot;

USA Today reported the news Thursday.

&quot;While some of these changes are difficult, we must ensure we have the right teams in place with the right capabilities to lead the company into the future,&quot; Hasbro said in a statement.

These job cuts come just months after the company&#39;s rival, Mattel, also said it was trimming its workforce and shuttering its New York Office.

Hasbro is scheduled to report third-quarter earnings before the market open Monday.
