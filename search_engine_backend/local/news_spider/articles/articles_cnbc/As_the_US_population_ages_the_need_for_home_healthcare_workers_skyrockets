As the US population ages, the need for home health-care workers skyrockets|http://www.cnbc.com/retirewell|http://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/31/as-the-us-population-ages-the-need-for-home-health-care-workers-skyrockets.html||2018-05-31|Kate Rogers||Each day, some 10,000 seniors turn 65 in the United States, and the majority of them are hoping to age in their own homes. The staggering number of aging Americans has created demand for home health-care workers — from nurses to aides and caregivers.

Jobs in health care have already been growing at breakneck speed. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, from 2006 through 2016 2.8 million jobs were added in the health-care sector at a rate that was seven times faster than the rest of the economy. Through 2026, the projected growth of jobs in health-care settings is at 18 percent. But the demand for home health and personal care aides will far outpace the sector&#39;s growth, with an increase of 41 percent to more than 4 million jobs.

&quot;The demand for home care and hospice continues to grow as we see a graying of the U.S. population,&quot; said Bill Dombi, president of the National Association for Home Care and Hospice, adding that both younger and older patients are pivoting ever more toward in-home care. &quot;The shift has also been in financing from government sources — primarily through Medicare and Medicaid. In 2015, it was the first time nationally that more money was spent on home care than nursing home care. We&#39;ve seen a culture and financing shift toward home and community-based care.&quot;

Opportunities in the industry range from the highest level of skilled nurses and therapists through paraprofessionals, including home health and personal care aides, Dombi said. Lower-skilled positions may not require medical degrees, but they do often require training and a competency test.

Homewatch CareGivers is just one company looking for recruits to meet the growing need for aides. They employ some 5,000 caregivers nationwide with a focus on in-home care for seniors. They also serve disabled children and veterans. CEO Julie Smith said her franchisees in more than 200 cities in the U.S. are growing revenue at double digits annually.
