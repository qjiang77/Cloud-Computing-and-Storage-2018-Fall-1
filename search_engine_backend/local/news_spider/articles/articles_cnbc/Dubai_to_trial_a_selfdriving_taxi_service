Dubai to trial a self-driving taxi service|http://www.cnbc.com/world|http://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/15/dubai-to-trial-a-self-driving-taxi-service.html||2018-10-15|Anmar Frangoul,Caowei,Moment,Getty Images,Handout||Dubai&#39;s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) has unveiled what it describes as the region&#39;s first autonomous taxi.



In a statement Sunday, the RTA said the technology underscored its commitment to enhance the Dubai government&#39;s strategy to turn 25 percent of mass transit journeys in the emirate into autonomous ones by 2030.



Ahmed Bahrozyan, CEO of the RTA&#39;s Public Transport Agency, said that the vehicle featured &quot;high safety and security standards&quot; and was able to monitor objects that had the potential to trigger collisions.



Bahrozyan said that a three month trial run of the vehicle would start toward the end of 2018 on designated routes.



&quot;The vehicle can drive at a speed of up to 35km (kilometers) per hour and can accommodate four riders including a standby driver in the cabin,&quot; he added.



&quot;The driver&#39;s service can be called in when the vehicle experiences a potential technical glitch by pressing a button, which shifts the operation from autonomous driving to the human driving mode.&quot;



As technology develops, a number of &quot;self-driving&quot; milestones are being reached in countries around the world.



In August 2018, for example, the Hyundai Motor Company announced that the first journey by an autonomous truck on a highway in South Korea had taken place.



The auto firm&#39;s Xcient truck, which has a maximum load capacity of 40 tons, drove around 40 kilometers between Uiwang and Incheon.
