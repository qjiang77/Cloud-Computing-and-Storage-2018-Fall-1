The Trump administration's tariffs and shrinking demand are hurting Micron's stock and worrying Wall Street. But the company's $10 billion buyback could be exceedingly useful for keeping its shares afloat, CNBC'sJim Cramer said Friday.

"Yes, historically, this is a boom-and-bust company," the "Mad Money" host said. "But this time may be different, because Micron has never, ever, ever had a $10 billion buyback underneath its stock when it reported bad news."

So before investors sell Micron, they should remember that one our of five of their shares could be bought back by the company via this monster buyback, Cramer said.

"I expect some continued selling until all the hot money has left the stock. But I think we might look back and wonder whether, unlike all the other times, Micron finally has a meaningful buyback that could act as a safety net, if not a trampoline," he said.

"And, hey, if demand for Micron's chips re-accelerates, you know what? Well, with that buyback going on, I think the potential upside could be enormous."
