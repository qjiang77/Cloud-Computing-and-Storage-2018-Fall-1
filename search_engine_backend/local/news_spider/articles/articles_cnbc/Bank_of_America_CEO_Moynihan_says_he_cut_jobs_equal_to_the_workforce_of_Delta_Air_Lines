Bank of America CEO Moynihan says he cut jobs equal to the workforce of Delta Air Lines|http://www.cnbc.com/netnet|http://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/17/bank-of-america-ceo-brian-moynihan-on-cutting-100000-jobs.html||2018-10-17|Hugh Son,Heidi Gutman,Gregory Bull,Scott Mlyn,Peter Foley,Bloomberg,Getty Images,Visual China Group,J. Emilio Flores,Corbis||Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said that the adoption of technology at the second-biggest U.S. lender has allowed him to cut 100,000 workers in less than a decade.

&quot;The straightforward way to get people to feel it is this: We had 288,000 people when I took over as CEO on Jan 1st [2010],&quot; Moynihan said in a Tuesday interview with Becky Quick at CNBC&#39;s Net/Net Summit at the New York Stock Exchange.

&quot;We had 204,000 last quarter. Step back and think about that,&quot; Moynihan said. The reduction is &quot;more employees than Delta has I think. All caused by the ability to apply technology to processes and capabilities, and customer behavior changed.&quot;

Moynihan appears to be correct: Delta Air Lines has more than 80,000 employees, according to its website.

Bank of America&#39;s headcount peaked at about 305,000 after he took over, Moynihan said. The bank hired furiously in the aftermath of the financial crisis to help resolve mortgage-related woes tied to the acquisition of Countrywide Financial.

Bank of America began plotting out its digital strategy in 2008 due to a need to reduce costs, Moynihan said. While online banking has been around since the 1990s, Apple&#39;s introduction of the first iPhone in 2007 was a game changer, he said. It effectively allowed customers to carry a bank branch in their pockets.
