Cramer Remix: PPG just turned whole swaths of this market toxic|http://www.cnbc.com/mad-money|http://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/09/cramer-remix-ppg-just-turned-whole-swaths-of-this-market-toxic.html||2018-10-09|Elizabeth Gurdus,Alex Wong,Getty Images,Daniel Acker,Bloomberg,Victor J. Blue,Nikada||Specialty chemicals company PPG Industries managed to sour the outlook for huge portions of the broader stock market with its negative earnings pre-announcement, CNBC&#39;s Jim Cramer said Tuesday.

&quot;It turned whole swathes of this market toxic from the get-go today,&quot; the &quot;Mad Money&quot; host said. &quot;One thing&#39;s for certain: any company with any exposure to the auto industry or the price of oil, for that matter — not to mention the strong dollar and the rising cost of transportation — will now be considered to be something that should be held for sale unless proven innocent.&quot;

Widely considered to be an economic proxy given its array of different end markets, PPG&#39;s weaker-than-expected earnings and forecast translated into the stark industrial sector weakness seen in Tuesday&#39;s trading session, Cramer said.

&quot;I bet a whole host of industrials turn out to be a lot more like PPG than we&#39;d want,&quot; he said, adding that he wasn&#39;t sure how news of activist firm Trian Partners&#39; investment in PPG would affect the coatings maker&#39;s future.

&quot;I don&#39;t know what will happen here with [Trian chief Nelson] Peltz and with PPG,&quot; Cramer said. &quot;The company says it looks forward to maintaining a healthy dialogue. Me? I just wish its business were healthier.&quot;
