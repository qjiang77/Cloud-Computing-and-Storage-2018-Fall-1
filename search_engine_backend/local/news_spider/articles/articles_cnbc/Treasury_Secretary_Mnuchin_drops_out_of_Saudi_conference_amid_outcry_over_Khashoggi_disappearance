&quot;Just met with @ realDonaldTrump and @ SecPompeo and we have decided, I will not be participating in the Future Investment Initiative summit in Saudi Arabia,&quot; Mnuchin wrote in a post on Twitter.

Mnunchin did not provide a reason. Just last week, he told CNBC he was still planning to attend.

&quot;We are concerned about what is the status of Mr. Khashoggi â€¦ (but) I am planning on going at this point,&quot; Mnuchin said.

Many other Wall Street power players and international finance leaders have announced that they would no longer be attending the conference, dubbed &quot;Davos in the Desert.&quot;
