GOP political apps create 'safe space' away from Facebook and Twitter|https://www.cnbc.com|https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/20/gop-political-apps-create-safe-space-away-from-facebook-and-twitter.html||2018-10-20|Matthew J.

The Times highlighted a new generation of mobile applications made for the National Rifle Association and the Great America pro-Trump political action committee (PAC), which deliver curated partisan news feeds on what are effectively private social media platforms.

These apps are gaining attention at a time when Silicon Valley has been accused repeatedly of using their power to stifle right-leaning voices.

&quot;People with center-right views feel like the big social platforms, Facebook and Twitter, are not sympathetic to their views,&quot; said Thomas Peters, CEO of uCampaign, the Washington startup behind the NRA and Great America apps.

Peters added that the apps are &quot;creating a safe space for people who share a viewpoint, who feel like the open social networks are not fun places for them.&quot;

While looking to propagate their message outside the offerings of Big Tech ahead of next month&#39;s midterm election, these mini-platforms also actually aim to harness the enormous reach of those networks. The Times noted that the right-leaning platforms offer options to post messages on Facebook and Twitter that are scripted by the campaigns.

Democratic candidates, including former President Barack Obama, have used consumer-facing apps to promote their political campaigns and advocacy. This year, Democratic campaigns are also embracing peer-to-peer text messaging, believed to engage younger voters more than stand-alone candidate apps, the Times said.

Meanwhile, uCampaign recently started its own peer-to-peer texting platform, RumbleUp, for conservative campaigns.
