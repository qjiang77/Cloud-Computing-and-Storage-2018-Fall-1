Morgan Stanley joins venture firms betting space start-up Vector can launch a lot of small rockets|http://www.cnbc.com/netnet|http://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/19/morgan-stanley-is-betting-vector-can-launch-a-lot-of-small-rockets.html||2018-10-19|Michael Sheetz||Rocket builder Vector said Friday it has raised $70 million in a round of financing, with a Morgan Stanley alternative investment fund joining Silicon Valley backers.

Vector is developing small rockets priced at less than $3 million a launch. They are designed to be capable of putting up satellites and spacecraft about the size of a microwave, which are a premium part of the rocket market. Small rockets can save customers months of time getting to orbit but come at a higher cost compared with flying as a &quot;rideshare&quot; on a larger rocket like the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket.

CEO Jim Cantrell told CNBC that Vector is trying to do &quot;essentially what Henry Ford did with the automobile assembly line,&quot; but with rockets. Vector&#39;s end goal is to be launching more than 100 times each year, with this latest round of funding intending to get its two rocket types, the Vector-R and the Vector-H, flying to orbit.

&quot;We&#39;re looking to fly up to a dozen next year,&quot; Cantrell said. &quot;We&#39;ve got to get the Vector-R launched first but we&#39;re also hoping to have the inaugural Vector-H launch next year.&quot;

New York-based Kodem Growth Partners led the $70 million round in conjunction with the strategic opportunities business within Morgan Stanley Alternative Investment Partners. Previous investors Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Venture Partners and Shasta Ventures also joined this round.

&quot;What drew us to Vector was the vision Jim Cantrell and John Garvey painted for us about how space communications and the satellite industry were fundamentally changing,&quot; Lightspeed partner Alex Taussig told CNBC. &quot;They convinced us that there was this bottleneck, and if you solve the bottleneck then you will multiply the addressable market significantly.&quot;

The strategic opportunities business is a smaller fund within Morgan Stanley, which has about $475 billion total assets under management, and is only accessible to a limited number of the investment bank&#39;s clients.

&quot;Silicon Valley is where we got our start, but we have found that there was a huge interest in the New York money community,&quot; Cantrell said.&#39;

Space Angels CEO Chad Anderson tweeted congratulations to Vector, saying the company has &quot;by far the most efficient use of capital in the launch business.&quot;

Kodem operating partner Phil Friedman also joined Vector&#39;s board of directors, intending to help prepare the company for an initial public offering. Cantrell described Friedman as &quot;an insider in the aerospace industry,&quot; noting that Friedman has been in buy-side and sell-side roles on Wall Street for over 35 years.

&quot;We were very impressed with management&#39;s forwarding looking view regarding how to ramp production once the development phase had ended,&quot; Friedman said in an email.

While Friedman said Kodem&#39;s investment does not have a &quot;preconceived philosophy regarding exit,&quot; Cantrell estimated an IPO for Vector is about three years away.

&quot;We think the new space community needs more IPOs and intend to be the ones leading that,&quot; Cantrell said. He added that he&#39;s seen anecdotal interest from the public, with retail investors asking to buy shares in Vector. Cantrell said he&#39;s hopeful an IPO is in only a few years, and he&#39;s &quot;trying to give the public and our investors a feel for what it&#39;s like to develop a rocket company.&quot;
