Job growth slumps in September, but the unemployment rate hits the lowest level since 1969|http://www.cnbc.com/economy|http://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/05/us-nonfarm-payrolls-september-2018.html||2018-10-05|Jeff Cox||Job growth slumps in September as US adds 134,000 jobs 10:42 AM ET Fri, 5 Oct 2018 | 01:49

Job creation for September fell to its lowest level in a year though the unemployment rate dropped to a point not seen in nearly 50 years, according to Labor Department figures released Friday.

Nonfarm payrolls rose just 134,000, well below Refinitiv estimates of 185,000 and the worst performance since last September, when a labor strike weighed on the numbers. The unemployment rate fell two-tenths of a percentage point to 3.7 percent, the lowest level since December 1969 and one-tenth of a percentage point below expectations.

A separate measure of unemployment that includes discouraged workers and those holding jobs part-time for economic reasons — sometimes called the "real unemployment rate" — edged higher to 7.5 percent.

Unemployment among black Americans declined three-tenths of a point to 6 percent, slightly above its record low of 5.9 percent achieved in May.
