Nicole Kidman Looks Unrecognisable In Gritty 'Destroyer' Trailer|http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au|http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2018/10/17/nicole-kidman-looks-unrecognisable-in-gritty-destroyer-trailer_a_23564500/?utm_hp_ref=au-homepage|Nicole Kidman|2018-10-17|Cole Delbyck||Nicole Kidman knows a little something about transforming for a role. But this time around, she&#39;s ditched the facial prosthetics (if you haven&#39;t seen &quot;The Hours,&quot; literally, what are you doing?) for a severe make-under in her new movie &quot;The Destroyer.&quot;

The first trailer for the crime thriller helmed by &quot;Jennifer&#39;s Body&quot; director Karyn Kusama arrived on Wednesday, and it shows the Academy Award-winner as you&#39;ve never seen her before.

Kidman stars as LAPD detective Erin Bell, whose undercover mission with a California gang that includes &quot;Avengers&quot; star Sebastian Stan goes horribly wrong. Years later, she&#39;s still dealing with the fallout with her daughter when the leader of the gang suddenly resurfaces with a vengeance.

&quot;I grew up on these kind of films,&quot; Kidman told Entertainment Weekly about her role as the hardened detective. &quot;I watched [Al] Pacino play these roles, I watched all of the men in the &#39;70s get the chance to do it, but I don&#39;t have a female [equivalent]. That&#39;s exciting as an actress to get the chance to do that.&quot;

The film received rave reviews at the Telluride Film Festival last month, with many critics calling Kidman&#39;s performance her best to date and a possible contender come Oscar season.

&quot;This character is also so far removed from me, so that&#39;s part of the appeal as an actor: going to places I haven&#39;t been given the chance to go,&quot; Kidman told Entertainment Weekly of the acting challenge. &quot;I&#39;m all about finding characters and stories that [make me] go, &#39;This is new, but it&#39;s still emotionally relevant.&#39;&quot;

&quot;Destroyer,&quot; which is set to hit theaters Dec. 25, also stars Toby Kebbell, Tatiana Maslany and Bradley Whitford.
