Okay, maybe that’s a slight exaggeration but shops have already started focusing their efforts on what we’re going to buy this festive season.

So if you’re wondering what’s going to be on your kids’ lists this year, this could put you ahead of the game. Hamleys has released its top 12 toys for Christmas, featuring some classics (LEGO) and new arrivals we predict will be big (Crate Creatures).

The shortlist comes after months of researching and planning by the Hamleys toy buyers and features prices from as little as £8, to as much as £80.

“We have cute, we have cuddly, we have fun, we have education, but this year in some of our toy categories we are also seeing an antidote to the highly polished perfectionism portrayed in many social media channels,” said Victoria Kay, head buyer at Hamleys.
