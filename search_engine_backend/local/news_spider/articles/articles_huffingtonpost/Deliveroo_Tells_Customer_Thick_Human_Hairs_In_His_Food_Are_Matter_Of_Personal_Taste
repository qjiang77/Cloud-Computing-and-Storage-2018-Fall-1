Darren Wood, 31 was disgusted to find the hairs tucked into his bacon cheeseburger from Byron Burger, which was delivered by Deliveroo at 7pm on September 16.

The insurance advisor from Norwich immediately complained to the food tech firm, but it refused to compensate him for the spoilt meal.

A member of Deliveroo customer service team wrote: “I’m sorry to hear you weren’t happy with you order however I’m unable to offer a refund or credit as this is a matter of personal taste.”
