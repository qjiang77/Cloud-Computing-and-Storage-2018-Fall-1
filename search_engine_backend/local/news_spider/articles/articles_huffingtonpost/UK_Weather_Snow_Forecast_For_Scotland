UK Weather: Snow Forecast For Scotland|http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk|http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/uk-weather-snow-forecast-for-scotland_uk_5bc9b683e4b0a8f17eeb560e?cz&utm_hp_ref=uk-homepage||2018-10-19|Sara C Nelson,Senior Editor,Huffpost Uk||The icy grip of winter is on its way, with snow forecast in the Scottish Highlands from the end of next week.

Cold air masses will affect the UK as we approach November. While many areas will stay brisk and dry, there is a risk of some showers falling as snow on higher ground, though the Met Office points out this is not unusual for this time of year.

This weekend the weather will be settled in the south east, with temperatures hovering around 16-18C, and itâ€™s due to be warm and mild in the north west too.

It will be noticeably colder on Sunday moving into Monday, dropping the mercury down to a more typical 12-14C. Monday morning could see a ground frost and rural areas can expect freezing temperatures.
