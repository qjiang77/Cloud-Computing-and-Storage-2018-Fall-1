The president made the offensive remark in a tweet celebrating a federal judge’s decision to dismiss a defamation lawsuit against him brought by Daniels, a porn star who has alleged she had an affair with Trump in 2006.

“Great, now I can go after Horseface and her 3rd rate lawyer in the Great State of Texas,” Trump tweeted, apparently referring to attorney Michael Avenatti. “She knows nothing about me, a total con!”
