Usain Bolt introduced the world to his signature celebratory pose a decade ago as he dominated in track and field ― and he’s certainly maintaining his style now in professional soccer. The Jamaican sprinting legend scored two goals on Friday in his first start for Australian professional soccer club Central Coast Mariners, following months of training stints with teams in Germany, South Africa and Norway.

The retired eight-time Olympic gold medalist, who broke his own world record in the 100-meter dash in 2009, has been in an “indefinite training period” with the Australian club with hopes of securing a place on the team for its upcoming season, The Associated Press reported. “I’m here to prove to the world, as I said, that I can be a footballer,” Bolt said during a press conference on Friday, according to an ESPN video. “I can go push myself and see how far I can go.” He added: “I’m just excited to take it step by step and move forward.”
