7 Killer Teen Patti Variations To Rock Those Card Sessions This Diwali|http://www.huffingtonpost.in|http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2015/11/05/teen-patti-diwali_n_8458142.html?ncid=other_trending_qeesnbnu0l8&utm_campaign=trending||2015-11-05|Aashmita Nayar,Lifestyle Editor,Huffpost India||Diwali&#39;s just around the corner, and, for all card-playing lovers that means one thing - Teen Patti!

This popular card game (often referred to as Indian poker) sees interesting additions to its set of variations every year - making both losing and winning fun, provided you&#39;ve not gone the Yudhisthira way (let&#39;s face it, there are plenty of cunning Duryodhana&#39;s out there). Assuming you know the rules, here are some variations to try this year to make the most of these fun parties. And for those who don&#39;t play, this might be an easy way to join in all the fun -- simply suggest your expert variation, sit back and watch all the fun unfold!

1. Odd sequence: Instead of your general sequences which would be Ace-2-3 or Jack-Queen-King, use alternate cards to declare a sequence: Ace, 3, 5 or 9, Jack, King. For those who have terrible luck with straight cards might actually win this one!

2. 369 and a one-eyed Jack: All these cards (The Jack of Spades and Jack of Hearts are also known as one-eyed jacks) all become jokers. The other two Jacks (of diamonds and clubs) are not one-eyed, which can lead to a comical amount of confusion. To add to the chaotic scene, you can even call certain colours of 369 jokers, while declaring the others to be ordinary.

3. High-low: The card with the lowest value becomes the card with the highest value, and alternately the card with the highest value switches to being the lowest. For example, if you have drawn King of Hearts, 2 of Spades and 2 of Diamonds. Your King has lesser value than your pair of 2&#39;s, which is the highest of its kind. Mix it even further by adding a best of five to the mix. Deal five cards, discard two and then select your lowest and highest.

4. The ol&#39; card on the forehead (or maatha): Each player gets one card. Without looking at your card, stick it your forehead or place it there. This way all the players can see each others cards, but not their own. Based on pure estimation about the value of your card, start to big. The suspense is awesome, and cards ludicrously held to the head always make for some laughs.

5. Red and black: Deal one card in the centre after dealing three cards to all players. After every round, a fresh card is placed. If the card in the centre is red (hearts or diamonds), the game is played normally, with the value of the card declared as the joker. Example: If the card in the centre is 7 of Hearts, then all 7s become jokers. But if the card is black, then the game is based on muflis (where cards of the lowest value now become the cards with the highest value. Example: a sequence of 2,3,5 beats out an Ace trail). This is probably one of the best ways to ensure your players stay in the game for a longer time.

6. Folding joker: Each player is dealt four cards of which the last one remains unseen and separate from the other three. The third card dealt is a shown card that acts as a joker for everyone. For instance Person A has 7 of Hearts, 6 of Spades,9 of Diamonds (and an unseen card). Person B has 8 of Clubs, 8 of Diamonds and 4 of Hearts. The jokers in the game are 4 of Hearts and 9 of Diamonds for everyone in the game.

However, the minute a person folds (or packs in) his/her cards, his/her previously unseen card becomes the joker. Ouch!

7. Sudden Death: This one&#39;s best played towards the end of a card session. Simply distribute equal packs of cards to different players. Hold then between your ring finger and thumb and continue to drop till one person yells stop! Of the cards remaining, pick one single card of highest value you have left. The highest card wins!

(Anyone not dropping his or her set of cards will be eliminated).
