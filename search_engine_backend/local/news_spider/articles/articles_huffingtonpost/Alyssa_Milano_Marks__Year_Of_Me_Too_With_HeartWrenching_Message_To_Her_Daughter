Alyssa Milano Marks 1 Year Of Me Too With Heart-Wrenching Message To Her Daughter|http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au|http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2018/10/15/alyssa-milano-marks-1-year-of-me-too-with-heart-wrenching-message-to-her-daughter_a_23561891/?utm_hp_ref=au-homepage|Alyssa Milano|2018-10-15|Alanna Vagianos||Alyssa Milano shared a powerful and emotional message for her 4-year-old daughter, Elizabella, on Monday ― one year to the day after the actress tweeted “me too.”

“One year ago I recorded this for my daughter, explaining why I shared my story of sexual assault. I never expected to release it publicly,” the actress tweeted. “Now, I feel it’s too important not to share.”

Milano recorded the video on Jan. 18, 2018, just three months after the Me Too movement captured the attention of the world. In the video, Milano speaks directly to Elizabella and describes why she wrote the now-famous callout on Twitter asking women to write “me too” if they had ever experienced sexual assault or harassment.

“When you get older and you watch this video, I wanted you to know that one night when I was lying in bed with you I looked down at you, and your sweet beautiful face,” Milano says in the video as she holds back tears.
