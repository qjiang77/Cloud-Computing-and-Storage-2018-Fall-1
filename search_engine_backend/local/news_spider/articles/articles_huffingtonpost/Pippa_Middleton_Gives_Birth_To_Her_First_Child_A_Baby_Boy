The two welcomed their first child, a baby boy, on Tuesday.

“Everyone is delighted and mother and baby are doing well,” a representative for Middleton told People, adding that the little one weighed in at 8 pounds, 9 ounces.

The happy news comes just days after a very pregnant Middleton was spotted with her husband at Princess Eugenie’s wedding to Jack Brooksbank on Oct. 12.
