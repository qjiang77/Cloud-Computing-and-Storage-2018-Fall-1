Viral Video: Former BSP MP's Son Ashish Pandey Brandishes Gun In A Delhi Hotel|http://www.huffingtonpost.in|http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2018/10/16/viral-video-ex-bsp-mps-son-ashish-pandey-brandishes-gun-in-a-delhi-hotel_a_23562261/?utm_hp_ref=in-homepage||2018-10-16|||A video of Ashish Pandey, son of former BSP MP Rakesh Pandey, went viral on Twitter for all the wrong reasons. Pandey pulled out a handgun at the entrance of a five-star hotel in South Delhi over a argument and threatened a couple.

In the video Pandey can be seen hurling abuses at a woman and her friend. The three women accompanying him, one recording the video and two others in the car, were also heard abusing the couple.

Hindustan Times reported sources as saying that the fight started when a woman (also seen in the video) objected to Pandey entering the women&#39;s washroom.

The video shows security guards from the hotel trying to keep Pandey away from the woman. And even as his own friends abused the woman, they pulled him back into the car when he brandished his gun at the two.

Reports say a case has been registered under the Arms Act against Pandey.

Delhi&#39;s deputy commissioner of police (south-west) Devender Arya told Hindustan Times, &quot;A complaint from Assistant Security Manager Hyatt Regency Hotel, R K Puram has been received regarding incident that occurred on the intervening night of October 13-14. Accordingly a case under sections 25 and 27 of the Arms Act has been registered..... Legal action is being taken as per law.&quot;
