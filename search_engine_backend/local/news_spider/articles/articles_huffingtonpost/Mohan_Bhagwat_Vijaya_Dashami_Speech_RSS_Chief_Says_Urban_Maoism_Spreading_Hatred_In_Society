Mohan Bhagwat Vijaya Dashami Speech: RSS Chief Says 'Urban Maoism' Spreading Hatred In Society|http://www.huffingtonpost.in|http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2018/10/18/mohan-bhagwat-vijaya-dashami-speech-rss-chief-says-urban-maoism-spreading-hatred-in-society_a_23564605/?utm_hp_ref=in-homepage||2018-10-18|Press Trust Of India||NAGPUR â€” Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat Thursday said Maoism has always been &quot;urban&quot; and the neo-Left doctrine of urban Naxals is to establish an &quot;anti-national&quot; leadership with blind followers solely committed to them.

He charged that &quot;urban Maoism&quot; was propagating falsehood and spreading hatred in the society.

Maoism has always been urban which used neglected sections of society to further its agenda, he said.

&quot;These people (Maoists) take strength from the country&#39;s enemies and always malign the nation wherever they go,&quot; he charged in his annual Vijayadashmi address at the RSS headquarters at Reshimbagh here.

To establish an anti-national leadership with blind followers solely committed to them is the &#39;neo-Left&#39; doctrine of these urban Naxals, he said.

Their cohorts already established in social media, intellectual circles and other institutions are associated with such activities, he added.

Through the manufacturing of a vicious atmosphere that weakens the social cohesion - essentially the bedrock of internal security of a nation a world of psychological warfare is being carved out, he charged.

&quot;This is called as &#39;Mantrayuddh&#39; in our traditional &#39;rajneeti shastras&#39;,&quot; he said.

Bhagwat said the government and the administration need to address this.

A number of well-known activists in the country were arrested in the recent past for their alleged links with naxals.
