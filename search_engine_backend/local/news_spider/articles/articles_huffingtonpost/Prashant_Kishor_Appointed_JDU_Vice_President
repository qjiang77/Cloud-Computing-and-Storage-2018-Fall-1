Kishor, who has worked for a number of parties as a poll strategist, recently joined the ruling party in Bihar. He is seen to be close to Kumar, also the state&#39;s chief minister.

Party spokesperson K C Tyagi said Kishor&#39;s appointment will help it reach out to social segments out of its traditional support base.
