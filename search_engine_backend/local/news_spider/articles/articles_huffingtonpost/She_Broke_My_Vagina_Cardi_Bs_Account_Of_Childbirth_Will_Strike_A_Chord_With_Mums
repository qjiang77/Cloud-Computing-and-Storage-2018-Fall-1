'She Broke My Vagina': Cardi B's Account Of Childbirth Will Strike A Chord With Mums|http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk|http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/she-broke-my-vagina-cardi-bs-account-of-childbirth-is-striking-a-chord-with-mums_uk_5bc9ab6ae4b0d38b58770068?fgi&utm_hp_ref=uk-homepage||2018-10-19|Sophie Gallagher,Reporter At Huffpost Uk||Mums all know that childbirth isn’t a walk in the park but singer Cardi B has confessed she had no idea that her baby, Kulture, would “break her vagina”.

Interviewed on the ‘Jimmy Kimmel Live!’ show, three months after giving birth to her first child, Cardi B was asked about her daughter’s arrival.

Responding to the question – was it easier or harder than you expected? – the 26-year-old said: “Totally harder, she broke my vagina. You know what, nobody tells you about those things, nobody told me they were gonna stitch my vagina.

“They say it’s gonna hurt but no one tells you that,” she added.

Her words echo Keira Knightley’s essay, ‘The Weaker Sex’ in the new book ‘Feminists Don’t Wear Pink (And Other Lies)’, in which the actor opens an account of giving birth to her daughter in 2015 with the line: “My vagina split.”
