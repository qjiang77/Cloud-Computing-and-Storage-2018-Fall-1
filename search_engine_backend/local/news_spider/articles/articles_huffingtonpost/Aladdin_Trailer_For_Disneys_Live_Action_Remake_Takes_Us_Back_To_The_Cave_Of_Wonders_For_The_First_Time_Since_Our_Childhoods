The upcoming movie is directed by Guy Ritchie - best known for ‘Snatch’ and ‘Sherlock Holmes’ - and stars Mena Massoud as the titular character.

The teaser trailer strikes a similar tone to the nostalgia-inducing first trailer for the live action remake of ‘Beauty And The Beast’, with an opening that sets the scene in the fantastical world of Agrabah.

We get a chance to see a parrot - presumably Jafar’s companion Iago - flying over the sand dunes with the city in the background.
