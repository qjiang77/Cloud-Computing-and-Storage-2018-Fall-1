Barbara Broccoli, who decides who takes on the coveted role of 007, also admitted she doesn’t believe the films are feminist.

Speaking to the Guardian, Barbara said it was unlikely Daniel Craig’s successor as the British spy would be female. “Bond is male. He’s a male character. He was written as a male and I think he’ll probably stay as a male, she said. “And that’s fine. We don’t have to turn male characters into women. Let’s just create more female characters and make the story fit those female characters.” On why the Bond franchise is not a feminist property, Barbara explained people often “reference those early movies”. “It was written in the 50s, so there’s certain things in (Bond’s) DNA that are probably not gonna change,” she said.
