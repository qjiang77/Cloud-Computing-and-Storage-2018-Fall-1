The news came after the BBC confirmed usual judge Bruno Tonioli will be taking a week off from the show. No reason was given for Bruno’s absence, but considering the 62-year-old judges both ‘Strictly’ and the US version ‘Dancing With The Stars’ at the same time, he surely can’t be blamed for wanting a break. Following the announcement that Alfonso will be stepping in, we take a closer look at why exactly the BBC may have picked him...

Believe it or not, he actually knows more than a thing or two about dancing Alfonso has been dancing from a young age, and was even nominated for an award at the age of eight when he played a lead role in the Broadway musical ‘The Tap Dance Kid’. But perhaps what qualifies him most to be ‘Strictly’ judge is that he won the American version of the show, ‘Dancing With The Stars’ in 2014 with his pro partner Witney Carson. He was a favourite throughout the series, and even recreated his iconic ‘Fresh Prince’ dance to Tom Jones’ ‘It’s Not Unusual’ for one special routine. The pair pulled in 36 points for their performance, with judge Len Goodman (yes, our very own Len), remarking at the time: “Fantastically done, that was without question the best dance of the night.”
