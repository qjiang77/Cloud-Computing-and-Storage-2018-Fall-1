Kim Kardashian Blasts Sisters For Looking Like 'F**king Clowns' During Japan Trip|http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au|http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2018/10/08/kim-kardashian-blasts-sisters-for-looking-like-f-king-clowns-during-japan-trip_a_23554624/?utm_hp_ref=au-homepage|Kim Kardashian|2018-10-08|Carly Ledbetter||Sister drama is taking center stage during this season’s “Keeping Up With the Kardashians.”

Kim Kardashian continued to attack her sister, Kourtney, and also took aim at Khloe during Sunday’s episode documenting their trip to Japan.

Kim was modeling looks from Yeezy Season 7 during the trip and was under pressure to get all the outfits photographed during a short time frame. She redirected her stress by calling out Kourtney and Khloe for wearing clothes that totally clashed with her Kanye-designed outfits.

“I can’t even eat dinner because I’m so disgusted with my sisters’ crazy outfits that completely don’t go with my look,” Kim said, according to People. “Like, I can’t take it.”

“My sisters look so crazy, it’s actually embarrassing,” Kim added, “Kourtney with the Japanese-inspired outfit, and Khloé is wearing silver sequins, turquoise eyeshadow, huge chandelier earrings — they’re just like, completely clashing and making my outfit look really bad and they’re ruining everything.”
