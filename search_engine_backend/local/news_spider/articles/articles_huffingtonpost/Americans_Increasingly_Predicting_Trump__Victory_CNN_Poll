Americans Increasingly Predicting Trump 2020 Victory: CNN Poll|http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au|http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2018/10/14/americans-increasingly-predicting-trump-2020-victory-cnn-poll_a_23560825/?utm_hp_ref=au-homepage|Donald Trump|2018-10-14|Andy Mcdonald,Comedy Editor,The Huffington Post||The percentage of Americans who believe President Donald Trump will win a second term is increasing, a new CNN poll finds.

Forty-six percent of those polled think Trump will defeat his Democratic opponent in 2020, as opposed to 47 percent who think he will lose. The poll comes with a 3.8 percent margin of error, so essentially it’s a draw.

However, the surprising takeaway seems to be that the public thinks Trump’s odds are improving. In March, 54 percent of Americans believed the president would lose in 2020.

Of course, as CNN’s report notes, these predictions have proved wrong in the past. Polls from 1995 and 2010 showed a majority of Americans predicting presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton would lose re-election.

Regardless, the uptick in people foreseeing a Trump win may be related to how Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents feel about the party’s potential 2020 candidates. The field is large and support is currently scattered.

The poll shows former Vice President Joe Biden leading the pack at 33 percent, followed by Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont with 13 percent, and Sen. Kamala Harris of California at 9 percent.
