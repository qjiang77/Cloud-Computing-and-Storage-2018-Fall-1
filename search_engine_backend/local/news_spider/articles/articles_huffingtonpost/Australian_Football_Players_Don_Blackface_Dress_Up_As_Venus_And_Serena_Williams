The trio, who play for a local Australian Rules Football (AFL) club in the state of Tasmania, dressed as tennis champions Serena and Venus Williams and Kenyan-born AFL player Aliir Aliir.

Photographs of the costumes surfaced on Facebook on Thursday, drawing immediate outrage from social media users.

“Some Australians still have no clue what is considered racist,” Twitter user Francis Gonzalez tweeted. “This Mad Monday “costume” is clearly racist. And I’m a person who is fed up with today’s over-the-top political correctness.”
