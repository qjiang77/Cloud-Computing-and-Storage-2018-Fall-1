Sandakozhi 2 Review: This Tired Sequel Is Not Worth Your Time|http://www.huffingtonpost.in|https://www.huffingtonpost.in/2018/10/19/sandakozhi-2-review-this-tired-sequel-is-not-worth-your-time_a_23565878/?ncid=other_topnaventr_coabgdcpxri&utm_campaign=topnav||2018-10-19|Mridula R.||N. Lingusamy&#39;s Sandakozhi 2, starring Vishal, Keerthy Suresh and Varalakshmi Sarathkumar, hits the screens 13 years after the blockbuster Sandakozhi.

Frankly, 13 minutes is all it takes to guess the crux of the sequel and question the point of the film. Even before the hero and his quest for revenge are introduced, it is obvious that Sandakozhi 2 will be a predictable watch.

If you have watched the first movie, there is little to take away from this sequel. Vishal&#39;s character belongs to a village where his father Rajkiran, fondly called &#39;Ayya&#39;, has the final say on pretty much everything. The people there believe that the Thiruvizha festival brings rains to their village, but the festival was stopped seven years ago after two groups got into an argument based on caste differences.

While Ayya tries to sort out the problem, the tiff blows up and the resultant brutal slaughter on both sides leads to Pechii (Varalakshmi Sarathkumar) taking an oath to kill Anbu, the last man alive on the other side.

Of course, Ayya will protect Anbu at any cost and Vishal also re-enters the village just in time for the action sequences to play out. Like in Sandakozhi, Vishal&#39;s Balu is the soft-spoken member of the family who at first doesn&#39;t butt into local politics. But these villages always need a demigod to survive and hence, he is forced to step in.

Sandakozhi 2 fails to build on the engaging drama of the first movie. The screenplay, which reminds us of the Thiruvizha set-up from the first movie, gets monotonous the second time around.

Keerthy Suresh&#39;s role is much like Meera Jasmine&#39;s in the first part—the only mystery is why the romance angle has to be as drawn out as it is.

Even with a hackneyed plot, the viewer&#39;s attention can be held if the scenes are gripping enough. Even the much-hyped character of Pechi (which reminded this reviewer of Shreya Reddy&#39;s role in Thimiru) fails to keep the viewer interested for too long.

The sheer amount of blood shed in this movie will make the viewer cringe. While Tamil Nadu&#39;s other Dussehra release, Vada Chennai, has smartly choreographed action scenes, the ones in Sandakozhi 2 do not hold the viewer&#39;s interest.

Walking out of Sandakozhi 2, only two elements remain on the viewer&#39;s mind—the comedy scenes involving Ramdoss and Keerthy Suresh&#39;s epic &#39;Kuthu&#39;, which gives us some reason to rejoice this festive season.
