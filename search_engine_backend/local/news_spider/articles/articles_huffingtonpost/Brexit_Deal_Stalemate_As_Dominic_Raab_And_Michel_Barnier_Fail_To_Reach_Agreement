Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab dashed to Brussels earlier today in a surprise visit.

But Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, said this evening that despite “intense efforts” some “key issues” remained unresolved.

And a spokesperson for Downing Street and the Brexit department said: “In the last few days UK and EU negotiators have made real progress in a number of key areas. However there remain a number of unresolved issues relating to the backstop.

“The UK is still committed to making progress at the October European Council.”
