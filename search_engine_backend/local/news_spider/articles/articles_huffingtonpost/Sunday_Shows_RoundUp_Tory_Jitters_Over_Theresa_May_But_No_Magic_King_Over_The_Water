Sunday Shows Round-Up: Tory 'Jitters' Over Theresa May But No 'Magic King Over The Water'|http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk|http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/sunday-shows-round-up-tory-jitters-over-theresa-may-but-no-magic-king-over-the-water_uk_5bcc64c2e4b0d38b587923a3?38&utm_hp_ref=uk-homepage||2018-10-21|Ned Simons,Assistant Political Editor,Huffpost Uk||The prime minister is entering the “the killing zone”, should “bring her own noose” as “assassination is in the air” - according to various reports this Sunday.

Brexit talks both in Brussels and within the Conservative Party are, let’s say, ongoing.

Dominic Raab used his appearance on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show to plead with Tory MPs who had “jitters” about the leadership to “hold our nerve”.

In his interview, the Brexit secretary conceded that the backstop proposal designed to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland will likely not have an explicit time limit.

“It could be time limited, there could be another mechanism,” he said. “There needs to be something which allows us to control how long we are there for to avoid any sense that we are left indefinitely in a sort of customs union limbo. That wouldn’t be acceptable.”

He suggested the transition period, currently set to run from March 2019 until December 2020, could be extended by “three months” or so.
