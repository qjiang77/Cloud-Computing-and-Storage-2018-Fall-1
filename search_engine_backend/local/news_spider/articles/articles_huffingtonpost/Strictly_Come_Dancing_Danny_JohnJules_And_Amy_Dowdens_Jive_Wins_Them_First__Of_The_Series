'Strictly Come Dancing': Danny John-Jules And Amy Dowden's Jive Wins Them First 10 Of The Series|http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk|http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/strictly-come-dancing-danny-john-jules-jive_uk_5bcc26dde4b055bc94817f96?ncid=other_topnaventr_coabgdcpxri&utm_campaign=topnav||2018-10-21|Daniel Welsh,Entertainment Reporter||‘Strictly Come Dancing’ star Danny John-Jules has become the first of this year’s contestants to get a 10 from the judges. In Saturday night’s live show, Danny and his professional partner Amy Dowden wowed the judges with their most impressive routine yet, performing a Jive to Ellis Hall’s ‘Flip, Flop And Fly’.

They ended up coming out on top of the leaderboard with the highest score of the night, and the series so far, scooping 37 points of a possible 40. It was Darcey Bussell who gave him his 10 points, while Craig Revel Horwood, Shirley Ballas and special guest judge Alfonso Ribeiro each gave him 9. Hot on their heels was actor Charles Venn, bouncing back after winding up in the dance-off for the past two weeks, and former Pussycat Dolls performer Ashley Roberts, who wound up in joint second place on 36 points each.

Charles’ performance was notable as the first Street routine on ‘Strictly’, following the introduction of the “couple’s choice” twist, which also saw Paralympian Lauren Steadman doing a Contemporary number. However, it was a less successful night for Capital DJ Vick Hope and her partner Graziano Di Prima. After winning praise for their chemistry last week, the pair failed to impress with their Cha Cha Cha to ‘More Than Friends’, scooping just 20 points for their routine, landing them at the bottom of the leaderboard.
