Police have also promulgated section 144 of CrPc in four places including Pamba, Sannidhanam to check any kind of protest and violence.

The Sabarimala Samarakashna Samithi, an outfit of devotees, has called the hartal to protest the Wednesday &#39;police lathicharge&#39; against Lord Ayyappa devotees at Nilackal, the base camp of Lord Ayappa shrine in Sabarimala.

The BJP and its NDA partners have extended their support to the hartal call.

The Congress said it would not join the strike but hold protest demonstrations across the state on Thursday.

Protesters opposing the Supreme Court order allowing the entry of women of menstrual age group into the shrine turned violent at Nilackal and clashed Wednesday and the police resorted to baton-charge.
