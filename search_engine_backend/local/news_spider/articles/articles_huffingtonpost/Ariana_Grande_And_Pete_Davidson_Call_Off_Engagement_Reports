Ariana Grande And Pete Davidson Call Off Engagement: Reports|http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au|http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2018/10/14/ariana-grande-and-pete-davidson-call-off-engagement-reports_a_23560870/?utm_hp_ref=au-homepage|Ariana Grande,Pete Davidson,Mac Miller|2018-10-14|Samantha Tomaszewski,Associate Social Media Editor||Ariana Grande and Pete Davidson’s whirlwind engagement has reportedly come to an end, according to multipleoutlets.

TMZ first reported Sunday that the couple has called off their engagement. They got engaged in June 2018 after only weeks of dating.

But the relationship may still have hope. A source told Us Weekly the couple is “working things out. They’re not officially done yet.” TMZ also reported that the two aren’t ruling out the possibility of anything in the future.

Grande had been reportedly taking “some much needed time to heal and mend.” Her former boyfriend, Mac Miller, died of an apparent overdose on Sept. 7.

“I feel like I won a contest,” Davidson told Jimmy Fallon in June when he initially confirmed the engagement.

Grande and Davidson committed to the relationship quickly, even getting tattoos that represented each other. Grande got a tattoo of the badge number of Davidson’s father, a firefighter who died in the Sept. 11 attacks.

Representatives for Grande and Davidson have not responded to HuffPost’s requests for comment.
