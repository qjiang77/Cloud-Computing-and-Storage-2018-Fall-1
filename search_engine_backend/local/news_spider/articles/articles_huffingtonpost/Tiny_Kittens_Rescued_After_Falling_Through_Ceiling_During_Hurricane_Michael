ABC News meteorologist Rob Marciano was reporting in Panama City, Florida, on Thursday when a local resident who rode out the storm led him to the young felines, who were nestled together in the debris of her storm-damaged house. The kittens had fallen through the ceiling when it collapsed, she told him.

The homeowners rescued the kittens from any imminent danger but had to leave them behind when they fled the house themselves, they told Marciano in an ABC News video. They said they had no idea where the kittens came from. “These kittens fell out of the ceiling and into the kitchen,” said Marciano in a video clip as he stroked the small animals. [The homeowners] didn’t even know that they were alive up there.”

&quot;They didn&#39;t even know that they were alive up there.&quot;
