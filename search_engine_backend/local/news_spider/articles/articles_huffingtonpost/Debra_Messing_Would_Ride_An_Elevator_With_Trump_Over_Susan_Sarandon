Debra Messing Would Ride An Elevator With Trump Over Susan Sarandon|http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au|http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2018/10/07/debra-messing-would-ride-an-elevator-with-trump-over-susan-sarandon_a_23553658/?utm_hp_ref=au-homepage|Debra Messing,Susan Sarandon,Donald Trump|2018-10-07|Cole Delbyck||Just how much does Debra Messing dislike Susan Sarandon? Enough that she’d much prefer some one-on-one time with her other nemesis, President Donald Trump.

The “Will & Grace” star, who’s publicly feuded with Sarandon on social media over their differing political leanings for years, admitted that, given the choice, she’d rather get stuck an elevator with the president than the actress.

“I think Trump,” Messing said when the question was broached on “Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen” Thursday night.

“Wow, I thought you were going to go the other way,” Cohen remarked. “But, you know what, maybe you could make some policy changes.”

“Yes!” Messing said. “I think that, you know, if I had a moment alone with him that maybe I could.”

Cohen agreed, describing her as a “very convincing person.”
