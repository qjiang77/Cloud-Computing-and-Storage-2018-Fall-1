Natalie Portman has some choice words for men who have a habit of calling women “crazy” or “difficult.” In her acceptance speech as an honoree at Variety’s Power of Women Event on Friday, the Oscar-winning actress listed off advice on what people can do to help women and increase equality in the world. One idea in particular sparked loud cheers, applause and appreciative laughter from the audience. “Stop the rhetoric that a woman is crazy or difficult,” said Portman. “If a man says to you that a woman is crazy or difficult, ask him, ‘What bad thing did you do to her?’”

Gonzalez was moved to tears during her speech, which touched on the trauma she went through as a student at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, where a gunman killed 17 people in February. She encouraged people with large platforms to spread the word on the importance of taking action and voting, saying, “Now more than ever women need to continue to rise up.”
