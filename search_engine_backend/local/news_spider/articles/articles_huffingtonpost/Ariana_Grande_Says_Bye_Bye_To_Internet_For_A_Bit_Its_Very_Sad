Ariana Grande announced Tuesday that she’s saying goodbye to the internet in the wake of her busted engagement to Pete Davidson, according to several outlets.

“Time to say bye bye again to the internet for just a lil bit,” Grande wrote in an Instagram Story that was later deleted. (However, several users captured it in screenshots.) “It’s hard not to bump news n stuff that I’m not trying to see rn. It’s very sad and we’re all tryin very hard to keep going. love u. and thank u for bein here always.” HuffPost did not immediately hear back from a Grande rep.

Grande led into her declaration with a reference to her participation in Tuesday’s taping of NBC’s “A Very Wicked Halloween” special celebrating the long-running Broadway show, People noted.
