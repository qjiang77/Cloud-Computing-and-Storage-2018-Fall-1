Inside The 'A Star Is Born' Champagne Pop That Wasn't Meant To Be|http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au|http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2018/10/06/inside-the-a-star-is-born-champagne-pop-that-wasnt-meant-to-be_a_23553057/?utm_hp_ref=au-homepage|Toronto International Film Festival,Lady Gaga|2018-10-06|Matthew Jacobs,Entertainment Reporter,The Huffington Post||They had one instruction: Don’t pop the Champagne.

So what did they do? They popped the Champagne, of course. Because rules do not apply when you’re among the world’s pre-eminent pop stars. And when you’re associated with the century’s biggest Broadway phenomenon, you go along with it, skipping nary a beat in the room ― or aircraft ― where it happens.

The Champagne bottle in question was stationed on a jet that Lady Gaga and Anthony Ramos boarded to shoot a scene for Bradley Cooper’s resplendent “A Star Is Born” remake. Gaga’s character, the rising singer Ally, is being flown out to join rock-star sweetheart and newfound mentor Jackson Maine (Cooper) on tour and brings her best pal (Ramos) along for the ride.

In the scene that plays out in the movie, the pair ― overwhelmed by the luxury of their circumstances ― frolic down a tarmac and through a plane, falling over each other in ecstasy as they board. The only direction Cooper had given them was to “jump on the couch” and have fun, so that’s what they did.

According to Ramos, who is best known as an original “Hamilton” cast member, the rental company that leased the private plane issued the aforementioned mandate to cast and crew: Don’t pop the Champagne bottle on the plane. But when the camera rolled for the first take, Gaga got carried away.

“Stefani and I were bugging out,” Ramos said of the shoot, using Lady Gaga’s real first name, as he always does, when I talked to him last month at the Toronto International Film Festival.
