Their Royal Highnesses have appreciated all of the support they have received from people around the world since their wedding in May and are delighted to be able to share this happy news with the public.

The exciting news comes just months after the royal wedding on May 19, which was watched by millions of people around the globe.

The royal couple wed at St. George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle in front of 600 guests, including famous faces like Oprah, Serena Williams, Elton John, Priyanka Chopra, David and Victoria Beckham and George and Amal Clooney.

Oprah described the wedding as “another level of everything.”

“It felt like more than a wedding,” the media mogul said in an interview with Extra. “It felt like a shift in culture. I left more hopeful.”
