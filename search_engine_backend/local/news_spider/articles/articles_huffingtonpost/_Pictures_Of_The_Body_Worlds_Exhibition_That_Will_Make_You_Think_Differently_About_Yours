6 Pictures Of The Body Worlds Exhibition That Will Make You Think Differently About Yours|http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au|http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2018/10/07/6-pictures-of-the-body-worlds-exhibition-that-will-make-you-think-differently-about-yours_a_23553653/?utm_hp_ref=au-homepage||2018-10-07|Connor Parker,Intern,Huffpost Uk||A bizarre but captivating exhibition opens in its new permanent UK home today.

Body Worlds features real human corpses that have been preserved through “plastination”, a method of preserving body tissue invented in the 1970s. The only thing missing is their skin.

It’s the brainchild of Gunther von Hagens, a German doctor famous for his pioneering work on body preservation as well as his videoed autopsies.

When appearing in public, even when performing anatomical dissections, von Hagens always wears a black fedora – a reference to the hat worn in Rembrandt’s 1632 painting, The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp.

Von Hagens, who suffers from Parkinson’s, has revealed that he wants his own body to be plastinated and added to the display when he dies.
