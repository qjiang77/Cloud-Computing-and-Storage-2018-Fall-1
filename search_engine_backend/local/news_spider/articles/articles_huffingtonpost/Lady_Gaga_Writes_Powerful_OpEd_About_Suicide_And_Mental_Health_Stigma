Lady Gaga Writes Powerful Op-Ed About Suicide And Mental Health Stigma|http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au|http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2018/10/09/lady-gaga-writes-powerful-op-ed-about-suicide-and-mental-health-stigma_a_23555980/?utm_hp_ref=au-homepage|Lady Gaga|2018-10-09|Cole Delbyck||Lady Gaga is lending her powerful voice to another urgent cause.

The “A Star Is Born” actress partnered with Dr. Tedros Adhanom, director general of the World Health Organization, in a moving op-ed for The Guardian calling for an end to the stigmatization of mental health services.

“Stigma, fear and lack of understanding compound the suffering of those affected and prevent the bold action that is so desperately needed and so long overdue,” the two wrote in a joint piece titled “800,000 People Kill Themselves Every Year. What Can We Do?” on Tuesday.

The pair note that mental health issues will touch one in four people in their lifetimes, and say young people are especially at risk.

“Despite the universality of the issue, we struggle to talk about it openly or to offer adequate care or resources,” they added. “Within families and communities, we often remain silenced by a shame that tells us that those with mental illness are somehow less worthy or at fault for their own suffering.”

The two to refer to suicide the as “the most extreme and visible symptom of the larger mental health emergency we are so far failing to adequately address.”

Gaga and Adhanom encourage readers to break the pattern that continues to “ostracize, blame and condemn” those who might be suffering, citing statistics that say suicide is the second leading cause of death globally among 15- to 29-year-olds.

They also reveal connections between mental health and a robust economy, making special mention of the sliver of global aid ― less than 1 percent ― that is directed to various services, while also noting that “domestic financing on prevention, promotion and treatment is similarly low.”
