1. Say yes

When new opportunities present themselves in the office, be ready to say yes. Whether it’s work-related training, an offer to lead up a new project, or maybe the chance of some business travel, a good professional should show they’re willing to take on a challenge and try something new.

Take the last of these for example – according to a recent Crowne Plaza® Hotels & Resorts survey, 25% of employees would opt for more travel as part of their job, and with good reason.

It’s not only a chance to open new doors and advance your professional life (over one in three people in the survey believe business trips help them get ahead in their career), but there’s the potential to learn about a new culture – a key skill in an increasingly globalised market place. Finally, business travel creates the chance to enjoy some downtime in a new and exciting environment.

2. Strike the right balance

We’re all familiar with the phrase ‘work/life balance’. Indeed for many of us it’s accompanied by a jaded laugh. After all, on the one hand we’re told that success means being prepared to work all hours, while on the other we know if we don’t meet the needs and obligations of family and friends, we’re likely to damage those relationships.

So think about how you spend downtime when you’re travelling and how to maximise it. Why not explore your new environment (88% of business travellers surveyed do just that), and then continue this trend back home.

Kathy Chalmers, Chief Human Resources Officer for major corporations, has some more suggestions: “There are great things you can do with your family, like exercise or making a healthy meal together, that will also have knock-on benefits for your professional life,” she says. “Also think about hobbies and pastimes that bring you into contact with new people outside your work environment, and that can provide you with a way to step away from the pressures of work.”

3. Make use of business apps
