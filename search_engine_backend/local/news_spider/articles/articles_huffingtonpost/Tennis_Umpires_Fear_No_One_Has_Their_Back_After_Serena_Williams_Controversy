Tennis Umpires Fear 'No One Has Their Back' After Serena Williams Controversy|http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au|https://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2018/09/12/tennis-umpires-fear-no-one-has-their-back-after-serena-williams-controversy_a_23525571/?ncid=other_topnaventr_coabgdcpxri&utm_campaign=topnav|Serena Williams|2018-09-12|Ron Dicker||The Serena Williams controversy has stirred resentment among tennis umpires ― and they are considering a boycott of her future matches, according to reports.

Retired umpire Richard Ings told ESPN Tuesday that a perceived lack of support for chair umpire Carlos Ramos after he penalized Williams three times in the U.S. Open finals match last weekend has fueled dissension.

“The umpiring fraternity is thoroughly disturbed at being abandoned” by officials with the Women’s Tennis Association who questioned Ramos’ rulings in such a high-profile contest, Ings said. “They are all fearful that they could be the next Ramos. They feel that no one has their back when they have to make unpopular calls.”

An anonymous source told The Times of London that umpires are considering a boycott of matches involving Williams.

“I do not believe there is a formal boycott in place so I do not think we need to take any action in regards to a boycott,” a spokesman for the U.S. Tennis Association told HuffPost on Wednesday.
