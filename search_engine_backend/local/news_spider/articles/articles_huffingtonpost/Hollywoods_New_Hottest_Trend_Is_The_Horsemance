Hollywood's New Hottest Trend Is The 'Horse-mance'|http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au|http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2018/10/09/hollywoods-new-hottest-trend-is-the-horse-mance_a_23555976/?utm_hp_ref=au-homepage||2018-10-09|Priscilla Frank,Arts Writer,The Huffington Post||Illustration by Priscilla Frank/HuffPost; Photos by Getty Liam Neeson and Russell Crowe both confessed to horsin&#39; around with their co-stars, horse and horse.

The most recent “mystery brunette” to skyrocket to tabloid fame is a New Mexico-based horse.

The brown beauty was last spotted whinnying and pawing the ground alongside two-time co-star, human Liam Neeson, on the set of his new film, “The Ballad of Buster Scruggs.”

“I play a traveling impresario. We filmed in New Mexico,” Neeson recounted agog to Page Six. “The odd thing is the horse who pulls my wagon knew me. ... He actually remembered me from another Western we made a while back.”

It was like Sandy crossing paths with Danny Zuko at Rydell High on the first day of school after spending summer nights making out under the dock. But with horse. And instead of engaging in bestiality, Neeson “fed him treats” and “gave him apples.”

“I love animals,” Neeson gushed. Not since he told his son to buck up and chase the girl of his dreams through a post-9/11 airport in “Love Actually” has the actor touched so many hearts.

Writer Anne T. Donahue tweeted a link to Neeson’s tale on Monday, calling it “the love story our generation deserves.”

“This is absolutely true,” Academy Award-winning actor Russell Crowe responded. This unexpected twist made my heart gallop out of my chest.
