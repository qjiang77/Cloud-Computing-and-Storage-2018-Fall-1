Selma Blair Discloses Multiple Sclerosis Diagnosis In Instagram Post|http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk|http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/selma-blair-instagram-ms-multiple-sclerosis_uk_5bcc3588e4b0a8f17eed4f38?wpg&utm_hp_ref=uk-homepage||2018-10-21|Daniel Welsh,Entertainment Reporter||The 46-year-old actress, known for her roles in ‘Legally Blonde’, ‘Cruel Intentions’ and ‘Hellboy’, shared her diagnosis on Instagram over the weekend, in a post in which she shared how the wardrobe team on upcoming Netflix show ‘Another Life’ had been particularly accommodating of her condition.

“I am disabled,” she wrote. “I fall sometimes. I drop things. My memory is foggy. And my left side is asking for directions from a broken GPS. But we are doing it. And I laugh and I don’t know exactly what I will do precisely but I will do my best.”

In the lengthy post, Selma revealed that she received her diagnosis in August, thanking a number of her friends in the industry, including her former ‘Cruel Intentions’ co-star Sarah Michelle Gellar, for their “love and support”.

She continued: “I am in the thick of it but I hope to give some hope to others. And even to myself.

“You can’t get help unless you ask. It can be overwhelming in the beginning. You want to sleep. You always want to sleep. So I don’t have answers. You see, I want to sleep. But I am a forthcoming person and I want my life to be full somehow. I want to play with my son again. I want to walk down the street and ride my horse. I have MS and I am OK.”
