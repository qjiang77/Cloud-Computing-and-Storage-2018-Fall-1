You're Probably Pronouncing 'Princess Eugenie' Wrong|http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au|http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2018/10/10/youre-probably-pronouncing-princess-eugenie-wrong_a_23557265/?utm_hp_ref=au-homepage||2018-10-10|Chris York||Princess Eugenie is getting hitched this Friday and if you’re planning on standing along the procession route and screaming her name then you’d better make sure you’re pronouncing it correctly.

The royal has heard it all apparently, saying earlier this year: “I am now used to every pronunciation.”

So what is it? “You-Jee-nie” or “You-Janie”?

Neither actually – it’s “YOO-junnee.”

YOO-junnee’s mother, SE-ra FIR-gusson, has spent her life introducing her daughter to foreign dignitaries so has developed her own way of helping people pronounce her name.

She said: “Whenever we used to meet foreign people who were struggling with it, my mum and I would help them by saying, ‘It’s like Use Your Knees.’”

So, there you go.

PRIN-sess YOO-junnee is getting married on Friday to JAK BRUKS-bank at WIN-zor CASS-ull at 11am.

More than 800 guests, 200 more than at HA-ree and MEG-un’s nuptials, will gather in the gothic chapel for the royal celebration.

The KWEEN and the royals, including the JOOK and DUT-chess of Cambridge and the Sussexes, are expected to be out in force, alongside YOO-junnee’s proud parents.

Celebrity guests are yet to be confirmed but those expected include former Take That singer ROB-EE WILL-E-ems and his wife and fellow X Factor judge AY-da.
