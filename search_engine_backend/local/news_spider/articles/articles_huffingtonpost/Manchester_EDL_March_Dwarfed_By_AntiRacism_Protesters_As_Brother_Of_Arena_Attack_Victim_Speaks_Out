Two arrests were made at the protest on Saturday, which saw police officers from Cheshire, Merseyside and North Wales attend to support local officers.

Some 150 counter-demonstrators turned up to outnumber the 50 EDL marchers who chanted to and from the cityâ€™s Piccadilly train station.

Both groups heard speeches and were separated by lines of police and metal barriers on Saturday afternoon.
