In the lead-up to the midterm elections, Trump has been rallying all over American, with one of the songs repeatedly used at the political events being the Prince staple ‘Purple Rain’.

Omarr Baker, Prince’s half-brother, has now responded to this in a tweet on behalf of the late singer’s estate, requesting that the President not use ‘Purple Rain’, or any other songs from the singer’s back catalogue, at his rallies in future. He wrote: “The Prince Estate has never given permission to President Trump or The White House to use Prince’s songs and have requested that they cease all use immediately.”

Prince died in April 2016, at the age of 57, of what was later discovered to have been an accidental fentanyl overdose. However, Prince isn’t the only musician whose music being used in a Trump rally has not gone down well, with Adele previously taking issue when ‘Rolling In The Deep’ was used at his political events.
