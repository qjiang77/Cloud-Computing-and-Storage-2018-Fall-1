So naturally, a trip to the good ol&#39; pumpkin patch is bound to be on your children&#39;s list of fall must-dos.

While some children challenge themselves to find the biggest, heaviest, most expensive pumpkin in all the land (much to their parents&#39; dismay), others find themselves drawn to the wee ones, which really works in everyone&#39;s favour. That&#39;s because there are endless creative ways for kids to decorate small pumpkins, meaning they&#39;ll be kept busy for hours.

To that end, we scoured Pinterest to find 15 of the best small pumpkin decorating ideas, which include little monsters and glow-in-the-dark designs. These will certainly entertain your young ones and get them in the Halloween mood.
