Backlash Against 'Disturbing' Language Used About 'Knifing' Theresa May|http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk|http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/backlash-against-disturbing-language-used-about-theresa-may_uk_5bcc7664e4b055bc9481b170?c2o&utm_hp_ref=uk-homepage||2018-10-21|Ned Simons,Assistant Political Editor,Huffpost Uk||A warning that Theresa May will get a knife “stuck in her front” has triggered an angry backlash.

The prime minister faces a difficult week described as the “killing zone” amid deep divisions within the Conservative Party over her Brexit strategy.

Some of May’s critics have claimed the 48 letters needed to trigger a no confidence vote in her leadership could soon be reached.

If 158 Tory MP then voted against her she would be ousted as leader.

A former Tory minister told The Sunday Times: “The moment is coming when the knife gets heated, stuck in her front and twisted. She’ll be dead soon.”

“Assassination is in the air,” one Tory MP told the paper.

Another source described as an ally of former Brexit Secretary David Davis said May was now entering “the killing zone”.

The language was condemned by Tory MPs on both the pro-Brexit and pro-Remain sides of the party.

Former Cabinet minister Theresa Villiers, a Brexiteer, said the comments about the PM in the newspapers were “disturbing”.
