Jim Carrey gave President Donald Trump a starring role when he reimagined the promo poster for hit 1973 movie “The Exorcist.”

From the bowels of the White House he shrieked, hurled curses and tweeted bile — because that&#39;s what demons do. YOU are the Exorcist. Vote Democrat for goodness&#39; sake. https://t.co/EphA7EosbP pic.twitter.com/riVcX0PHCH

“From the bowels of the White House he shrieked, hurled curses and tweeted bile — because that’s what demons do,” Carrey captioned his latest politically-charged image, which shows Trump angrily looming over all.

He also linked to the Vote.gov registration website.

See how it compares to the original poster:
