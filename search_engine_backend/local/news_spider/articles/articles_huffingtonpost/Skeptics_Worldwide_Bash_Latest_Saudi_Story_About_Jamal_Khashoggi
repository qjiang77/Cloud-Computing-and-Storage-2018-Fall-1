Skeptics Worldwide Bash Latest Saudi Story About Jamal Khashoggi|http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au|http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2018/10/20/skeptics-worldwide-bash-latest-saudi-story-about-jamal-khashoggi_a_23566957/?utm_hp_ref=au-homepage|Ted Lieu,Richard Blumenthal,Adam Schiff,Bob Corker,Rand Paul,Donald Trump,Lindsey Graham,Chris Murphy|2018-10-20|Mary Papenfuss,Trends Reporter,The Huffington Post||While President Donald Trump welcomed Saudi Arabia’s new statement confirming that journalist Jamal Khashoggi is indeed dead, blaming some kind of physical altercation in the kingdom’s consulate in Turkey, others in Washington and beyond expressed their stunned incredulity.

Saudi leaders had initially denied any part in the Washington Post columnist’s Oct. 2 disappearance. Intent on protecting the top tiers of the royal family, they had reportedly discussed blaming the incident on an interrogation accidentally gone wrong.

According to the kingdom’s official explanation, the dissident journalist was strangled in a fistfight involving 15 men sent to confront him.

Asked whether he thought the story was credible, Trump said, “I do.” He hailed the new information as a “good first step.”

Many others disagreed.

Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) said the explanation was “preposterous” and called for U.S. action against the Saudis.

“America’s moral compass has come completely unmoored if we don’t take action,” Murphy said in a tweet.
