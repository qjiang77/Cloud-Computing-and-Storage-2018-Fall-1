The airline says flight FI688 from Orlando to Reykjavik, Iceland, was over Canada when pilots noticed the crack in the window.

It says the crew followed standard procedures, and diverted to a nearby airport in Bagotville, Que.

Icelandair says the 155 passengers and seven crewmembers on board were taken to a hotel to rest.

It says another plane will pick them up on Saturday.
