Earlier this week, Gleb specifically name-checked Giovanni when sharing his belief there are more backstage romances on the show than viewers get to hear about.

“I think people like Giovanni and his partner or any of the others are making out when no one is seeing it,” Gleb told The Sun. “I cannot answer that question. It could well be happening.”
