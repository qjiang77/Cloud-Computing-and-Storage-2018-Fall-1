'The Cry' Episode 3 Review: 1 Answer And 7 More Burning Questions We Know Have|http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk|http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/the-cry-episode-3-review-questions-answers_uk_5bbf53c8e4b01a01d6882005?utm_hp_ref=uk-homepage||2018-10-14|Ash Percival,Entertainment Editor,Huffpost Uk||As the BBC’s latest thriller ‘The Cry’ continued on Sunday night, there was finally an answer to the series’ biggest question - who took baby Noah?

A dark twist in the tale (which will probably come of little surprise to people who had read the book of the same name by Helen FitzGerald) revealed that Joanna had seemingly accidentally killed her son with couple staging his kidnap as a way of covering up his death.

But if viewers thought that was the end of the story - they could not have been more wrong.
