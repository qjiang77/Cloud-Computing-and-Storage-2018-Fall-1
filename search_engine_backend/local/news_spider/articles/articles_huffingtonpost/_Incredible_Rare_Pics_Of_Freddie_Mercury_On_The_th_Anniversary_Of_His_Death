The Queen frontman died all too soon from an AIDS related illness on 24 November, 1991 at the age of just 45, just one day after confirming rumours that he had the disease.



His death saw an outpouring of grief from music fans across the globe, rarely seen before - or since.

He was an unforgettable, one-of-a-kind performer, but above all else, he was an incredible musician, responsible for some of the most played - and most memorable - songs of all time, including the classic single ‘Bohemian Rhapsody’.

His musical legacy continues to this day, with everyone from Lady Gaga (who named herself after a Queen song) to Katy Perry citing Freddie as an influence.

Here we celebrate his life, just as he had lived it, with 100 rare photos of him on and off stage doing what he did best, being the fabulously, outrageous Freddie.
