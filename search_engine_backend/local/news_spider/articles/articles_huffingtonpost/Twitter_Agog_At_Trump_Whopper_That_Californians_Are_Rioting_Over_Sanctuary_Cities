No one knew what he was talking about.

Twitter was dumbfounded.

Trump also again derided black congresswoman Maxine Waters, a California Democrat, as a “low IQ individual,” an insult he largely reserves for her and one that others have called racist.

Trump was stumping for Nevada GOP Sen. Dean Heller, and blasted both Waters and Heller’s Democratic rival in November’s election, Rep. Jacky Rosen, for their support of what he termed “deadly” sanctuary cities ― municipalities where local officials don’t cooperate with federal authorities to deport undocumented immigrants.

“A lot of people in California don’t want” sanctuary cities, Trump said. “They’re rioting now; they wanna get out of their sanctuary cities ... They’re demanding they be released from sanctuary cities.” (Check out the video above.)

No one’s rioting in California to escape sanctuary cities.

Stunned Toronto Star reporter Daniel Dale noted in a tweet that Trump is “now inventing nonexistent domestic riots.”

Ted Westrup, a spokesman for California Gov. Jerry Brown (D), told Dale that “Trump and truth have long had a troubled relationship. These comments, frankly, don’t merit a response.”

This Trump lie is quite something. The president is now inventing nonexistent domestic riots. https://t.co/Ch9ZSafXKx — Daniel Dale (@ddale8) October 20, 2018

Other Twitter users were furious or stunned by Trump’s comments, while some expected nothing less from the president. Several tweets checked in from all over California with the exact same report: No riots.

If Don is talking, he&#39;s lying. It&#39;s hard to comprehend millions still support him. GOP has been taken over by worst kind of human. — JO PIPES (@JOJap227) October 20, 2018

Kelly-Anne has been telling him all about the Bowling Green massacre again — Chris Smyth #FBPE (@ChrisDSmyth) October 20, 2018

He’s threatened to call out the military against migrants at the border. He’s setting up excuses to use presidential power to set the soldiers against the people. — Manya Zuba (@ManyaZuba) October 21, 2018

Crazytown, as his former friend Michael Cohen said. — MYOS (@MYOS4) October 21, 2018

Imagine what nonsense he&#39;ll be peddling as Nov 6 gets closer. Nation wide riots by Democratic mobs. Raping and pillaging along both borders. Fear mongering at its finest. When you have nothing to offer just scare the he&#39;ll out of the electorate. — Darren Brown (@scabbyhabby) October 20, 2018

When is someone going to declare him insane?!? — Katie Anderson (@nifty_raccoon) October 20, 2018

It’s not a lie, he is giving instructions to his base in California to start the riot. This is what con men do. — Nags (@nags8) October 20, 2018

In 1995 Umberto Eco wrote that at the center of fascist psychology was, “…the obsession with a plot, possibly an international one.” He believed that this was because fascist believers needed to feel “besieged”. — Patrick Donohue (@cogitounboxed) October 20, 2018
