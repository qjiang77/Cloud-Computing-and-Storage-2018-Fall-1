Meghan Markle's Half-Sister Pulls Awkward Stunt Outside Kensington Palace|http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au|http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2018/10/08/meghan-markles-half-sister-pulls-awkward-stunt-outside-kensington-palace_a_23554633/?utm_hp_ref=au-homepage|Meghan Markle|2018-10-08|Carly Ledbetter||Meghan Markle’s half-sister, Samantha Grant, isn’t done pulling publicity stunts across the pond.

Grant, who said she’s visiting London to try to see the duchess and mend family discord, was photographed outside Kensington Palace with a male companion handing a letter to a guard on Saturday. Grant, who has multiple sclerosis, was in a wheelchair pushed by her friend.

After reportedly being turned away from the palace, where the Duke and Duchess of Sussex live, Grant was seen buying cardboard cutout masks of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s face, according to photos obtained by the Daily Mail.

“Everybody would love to know what’s in that letter,” Grant tweeted Sunday, alongside three emoji faces and a Mirror article that shows her outside the palace.

Grant alluded to her reasons for writing to Meghan, replying in the comments of the tweet, “The Family spoke out about being treated unjustly by her. If someone treated you [unjustly] you would speak out. Truth happens.”
