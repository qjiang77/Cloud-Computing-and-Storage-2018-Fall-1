Man Stabbed At Haunted House After Knife Mistaken For Prop: Police|http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au|http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2018/10/10/man-stabbed-at-haunted-house-after-knife-mistaken-for-prop-police_a_23557269/?utm_hp_ref=au-homepage||2018-10-10|Nina Golgowski||Kesu01 via Getty Images A man is recovering after he was stabbed in the arm with a knife at a haunted house in Madison, Tennessee, on Oct. 5.

A man looking for a scare at a haunted house got one that he’ll likely never forget when he was stabbed with a knife that was mistaken for a prop, according to police.

The man, James Yochim, 29, said the real-life horror story began when he and his friends were approached by a costumed character at the Nashville Nightmare in Madison, Tennessee, on Friday night, according to a police report obtained by HuffPost.

The man, wearing skull face makeup and a straw hat, Yochim told police, offered his friend a knife after asking her if Yochim was “fucking around with her.”

“Keep in mind, we’d been chased by chainsaws, holding other weapons, all kinds of stuff all night, and it was all fake,” Yochim told the Tennessean.

Playing along, his friend, identified by Metropolitan Nashville Police as Tawnya Greenfield, 29, told the man yes, Yochim was bothering her.
