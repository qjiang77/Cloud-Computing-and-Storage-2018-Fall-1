Lady Gaga revealed she is engaged to talent agent Christian Carino during a speech at Elle&#39;s Annual Women in Hollywood Celebration Monday — and she did it using just three simple words.

The &quot;A Star Is Born&quot; headliner, was among those honored at the gathering and at the end of her speech she began to thank people, including her boo.

&quot;Thank you, Elle. Thank you all the loved ones in my life. ... Everybody at table 5. My fiancé Christian,&quot; Gaga said, per Elle.

This is the first time she has acknowledged that the couple plan to wed, according to the magazine.
