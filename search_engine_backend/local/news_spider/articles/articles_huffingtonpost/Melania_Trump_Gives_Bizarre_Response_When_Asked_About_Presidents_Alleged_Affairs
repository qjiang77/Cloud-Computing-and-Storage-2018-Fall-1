Melania Trump Gives Bizarre Response When Asked About President's Alleged Affairs|http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au|http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2018/10/13/melania-trump-gives-bizarre-response-when-asked-about-presidents-alleged-affairs_a_23560095/?utm_hp_ref=au-homepage||2018-10-13|Chris York||Melania Trump has finally spoken about her husband’s alleged infidelity, dismissing it as “not a concern”.

In a wide-ranging interview with ABC News, the First Lady gave a lukewarm response to a number of questions about their relationship.

President Trump has been accused of a string of affairs, most notably with adult film star Stormy Daniels who was paid $130,000 (£99,000) as part of a hush agreement signed days before the 2016 election.

She has since launched a lawsuit in a bid to dissolve the contract.

When asked if the allegations has “put a strain on her marriage”, she said: “It is not a concern and focus of mine.

“I’m a mother and a First Lady, and I have much more important things to think about and to do.”

When asked if she loved her husband, she said: “Yes, we are fine.

“It’s what media speculate (sic), and it’s gossip. It’s not always correct stuff.”
