A sagely king: Unique challenge faces LeBron in Los Angeles|http://espn.com/nba|http://www.nba.com/article/2018/10/11/lebron-james-age-entering-2018-19-lakers||2018-10-11|Sekou Smith||Shaquille O’Neal called it a “dream” when he signed with the Los Angeles Lakers as a free agent in the summer of 1996.

He was 24, entering the physical prime of his eventual Hall of Fame career while also poised to chase championships for perhaps the most glamorous NBA franchise at that time.

Shaq was following in the footsteps of the giants, literally, that came before him. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was 28 when he first pulled a Lakers jersey over his head, arriving via trade from the Milwaukee Bucks.

The Lakers luring a big star to the NBA’s brightest and most electric media market is nothing new. Said star showing up at the ripe old age of 33 (as LeBron James did this summer) is a different type of Hollywood story.

His decision to tackle this challenge 16 seasons into his career comes with a physical risk that his past free-agent moves (from Cleveland to Miami in 2010 and back to Cleveland in 2014) did not. Does he have enough left in his tank to lead the Lakers to the sort of heights he did the Heat and Cavaliers?

* Smith: Who might Lakers add in the future?

James’ early energy -- albeit in brief glimpses -- has been off the charts. The player who dominated the Eastern Conference for so long, leading his teams to eight straight trips to The Finals in the process, seems to be the same one who showed up in Los Angeles.
