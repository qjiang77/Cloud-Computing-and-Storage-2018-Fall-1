Radio Atlantic: Becoming White in America|http://theatlantic.com/podcasts|https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/04/radio-atlantic-becoming-white-in-america/558029/||2018-04-13|Kevin Townsend||Subscribe to Radio Atlantic: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | Google Play

In her new book Futureface, Alex Wagner writes that “immigration raises into relief some of our most basic existential questions: Who am I? Where do I belong? And in that way, it’s inextricably tied to an exploration of American identity.” In the book, Alex explores her own American identity – daughter of a Burmese immigrant mother and a small-town Irish Catholic father – and asks how true the stories we grow up with really are.



Along with co-hosts Matt and Jeff, Alex is joined by The Atlantic’s deputy politics editor Adam Serwer to discuss the tangled intersections of history, heritage, family, race, and nationality. Is America truly a melting pot? Can nationalism be liberal? And is that stalwart American immigrant story just a history written by the victors?
