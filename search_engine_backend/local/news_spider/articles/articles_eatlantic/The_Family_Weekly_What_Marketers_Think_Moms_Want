The Family Weekly: What Marketers Think Moms Want|http://theatlantic.com|https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2018/10/family-weekly-october-13-2018/572902/||2018-10-13|Natalie Escobar||This Week in Family

In an attempt to understand how marketers try to sell things to moms, the Atlantic staff writer Joe Pinsker attended the 14th annual “Marketing to Moms” conference, where marketers discussed the emotions that best characterize moms today: stress, doubt, and guilt. It’s a “bleak depiction of modern motherhood,” Pinsker writes, but marketers believe it makes for effective advertising, helping them peddle products like cookie gift boxes, Lysol, and lemonade. Stress, in short, is helpful for boosting consumerism.

The costs can reach sky-high prices—up to $1,400 for a session—but couples say that they value the photos for more than just a social-media post.
