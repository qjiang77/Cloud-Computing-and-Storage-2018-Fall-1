Lauren Williams and Taylor Lorenz Join The Atlantic|http://theatlantic.com/press|http://theatlantic.com/press-releases/archive/2018/04/the-atlantic-adds-lauren-n-williams-and-taylor-lorenz-to-growing-masthead/559268/||2018-04-30|||Washington, D.C. (April 30, 2018)—The Atlantic is growing its New York bureau with two new editorial hires: Lauren N. Williams joins as a senior editor on the Culture desk and Taylor Lorenz is joining the Technology team as a staff writer. The Atlantic’s editor in chief Jeffrey Goldberg and TheAtlantic.com editor Adrienne LaFrance announced the news today. Williams will start in June, after completing a Nieman Fellowship, and Lorenz will begin reporting for The Atlantic next month.

Williams comes to The Atlantic from Essence, where she has been features editor since 2014, and was a news editor before that. Most recently, Williams commissioned a report on the stark rates of maternal mortality for black women in America. She has spent a career in magazine journalism, with editorial roles at More and Marie Claire, in addition to stints at Redbook and Harper’s Bazaar. Williams will work with Culture Editor Jane Kim to shape new and ambitious ways for The Atlantic to grow its coverage of culture and entertainment, including Hollywood, books, and music.

In her new role as a staff writer, Lorenz will focus on the intersection of technology and culture. She most recently covered this beat for The Daily Beast, where she focused on social platforms, the mysterious world of online influencers, YouTube, and teen trends. Before that, she was as a senior editor at The Hill. Lorenz already has an Atlantic byline: in January she reported on the experiences of the parents of teen social-media stars.
