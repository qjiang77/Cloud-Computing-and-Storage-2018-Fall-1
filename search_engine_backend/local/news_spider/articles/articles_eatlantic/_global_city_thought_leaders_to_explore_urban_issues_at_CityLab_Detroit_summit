CityLab, which says it believes global change is inspired from the local level, is bringing its sixth conference to the city to &quot;draw inspiration from the ongoing story of Detroit&#39;s path to revival.&quot; The organization points to Detroit&#39;s entrepreneurial community as a way to address urban issues. The city is also labeled as a catalyst for technological progress &quot;that has yet to crest&quot; and one struggling with persistent inequality.

The invitation-only, free event is being put on Oct. 28-30 at the Westin Book Cadillac Detroit hotel by The Atlantic magazine, The Aspen Institute and Bloomberg Philanthropies.

Programs will be recorded for those unable to attend via livestream and podcasts.

&quot;It is a curated audience of people who are working to make cities more equitable and livable,&quot; spokeswoman Anna Bross said.

Organizers are tight-lipped about the invitation list, but representatives from 40 global cities, including those in the U.S., Portugal, Israel and Chile, have been confirmed, Bross said.

&quot;This is truly an exciting time in our city, with so many visible signs of progress and of work yet to be done,&quot; Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan said in a statement. &quot;Many of the topics that will be discussed, such as housing, transportation and opportunity, are the same issues we are working on every day. We look forward to listening and sharing our experiences.&quot;

The summit will explore opportunities in transportation, housing, public health and economic mobility. Conference-goers can attend various sessions to discuss such topics as the impact of technology and design on personal freedom, universal basic income, the opioid crisis and ideas to build stronger city communities.

A list of speakers and programming will be revealed in coming weeks. Field trips and other events will be on the agenda to get guests out of the hotel and into the city, organizers said.

CityLab Detroit is funded in part by presenting sponsors including General Motors Co. of Detroit, JPMorgan Chase & Co. , the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation and Mastercard Inc. The organization did not disclose how much it costs to put on the event.

CityLab Detroit follows prior summits organized in New York City, Los Angeles, London, Miami and Paris since 2013.
