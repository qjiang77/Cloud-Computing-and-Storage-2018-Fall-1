Engineers are fixing Silicon Valley|http://pandodaily.com|http://pandodaily.com/2018/09/27/engineers-are-fixing-silicon-valley/||2018-09-27|||A little over a year ago, I quit the tech journalism beat. And every day I thank God that I did.

It’s depressing enough to be a mere consumer of journalism right now, never mind a producer. It’s struggle enough to see newspaper headlines about Jack Dorsey and Mark Zuckerberg enabling neo-nazis or the FSB without punching a wall. I can’t fathom how soul-crushing it must be to actually have to call those fuckers, or their functionaries, and listen politely as they repeat their disingenuous excuses for hastening the end of civilization.

And, by Christ, there’s not enough pity in the world for the poor journalistic souls who have to report on whatever shitty thing Travis Kalanick does at his next company...
