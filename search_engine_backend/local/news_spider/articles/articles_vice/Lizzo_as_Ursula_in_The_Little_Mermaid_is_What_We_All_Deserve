On Sunday, singer Lizzo shared a beautiful dream. The 30-year-old let the world know that it has been a lifelong aspiration to play Ursula, the iconic villain from the 1989 film adaptation of Hans Christian Andersen&#39;s book The Little Mermaid. &quot;Just gonna put this back out there,&quot; she captions the video of her laughing while on a moving golf cart. &quot;It is my dream to play Ursula in the Lil Mermaid. Here’s my audition tape... @Disney.&quot;

Walt Disney Studios&#39; live-action reprisal of The Little Mermaid, a project that has been in the works for almost two years, has been getting buzz lately after casting rumors were publicized. In recent weeks, Lady Gaga was said to be up for consideration for the role of Ursula, although Disney has not confirmed the report; Zendaya is allegedly up for the lead role of Ariel.

But the only person officially attached to the highly-anticipated film is Hamilton creator Lin Manuel-Miranda, who will be working on the music for the fresh adaptation alongside veteran Disney composer Alan Menken.

But back to Lizzo...

Lizzo&#39;s Twitter announcement came with fanfare about how the boisterous beauty would be the perfect person to play Ursula. And after meditating on this, we absolutely agree. Here&#39;s why.

By nature, Ursula is a bad bitch. Let&#39;s consider this:

She used to live in the palace, throwing fabulous parties, and then was exiled because of the patriarchy. And maybe, also, because she is evil—but either way, Ursula was destined for royalty. Just like our fave, Lizzo.

Ursula is a witch with a crystal ball. As she sings in &quot;Poor Unfortunate Souls,&quot; the mermaid community would come to her for guidance. So, long story short, Ursula is wise and powerful. Lizzo is wise and powerful as well —and while we can&#39;t confirm that she has magic powers, she certainly is Black-girl-magic every day of the week.

Ursula&#39;s makeup and nail game is on point! She also has color-coordinated sea shell accessories. We stan a fashionable queen and that&#39;s exactly what Lizzo is.

Ursula knows how men work. She takes Ariel&#39;s voice while Ariel&#39;s running around on land with Eric, knowing that her beauty will be enough to win his love and progress her plan of domination. And she turns out to be right. Lizzo is all about women&#39;s empowerment and putting men in their place. Just listen to her song &quot;Boys,&quot; where she says, &quot;Baby, I don&#39;t need you (I don&#39;t need). I just wanna freak you (Want, I want it bad). I heard you a freak too (That&#39;s right).&quot; HELLO, a whole dissertation on men right there in song!

In conclusion: Give Lizzo her things, Disney! It&#39;d make her and all us extremely happy.
