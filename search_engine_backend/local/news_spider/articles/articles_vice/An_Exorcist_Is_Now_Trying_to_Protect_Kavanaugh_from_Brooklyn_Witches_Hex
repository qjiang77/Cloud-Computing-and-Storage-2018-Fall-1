An Exorcist Is Now Trying to Protect Kavanaugh from Brooklyn Witches' Hex|https://broadly.vice.com|https://broadly.vice.com/en_us/article/j5393d/brett-kavanaugh-witches-hex-exorcist-mass|exorcist,Life,lore,Culture,Lore,ritual,Brett Kavanaugh,WITCHES,hex,Religion,supreme court,Catland Books,Horoscopes,Power,Mass|2018-10-18|||A San Jose exorcist, Father Gary Thomas, announced his plans on Wednesday to hold a mass protecting Brett Kavanaugh from a ritual planned by witches to hex him this Saturday, October 20.

After one of New York&#39;s most famous occult shops Catland Books announced that they&#39;d be organizing the ritual to curse Brett Kavanaugh along with &quot;all rapists and the patriarchy at large,&quot; more than 10,000 people marked themselves as &quot;going&quot; on Facebook. But as the ritual grew in scope (Catland had to add a a second hex in November due to the number of people interested), the witches at Catland reported receiving backlash, including death threats.

Father Thomas, who works as an exorcist for the Diocese of San Jose, alleges that organizers and those attending the ritual are part of a &quot;cult&quot; that must be stopped.

“This is a conjuring of evil—not about free speech,” he told the National Catholic Register. “Conjuring up personified evil does not fall under free speech. Satanic cults often commit crimes; they murder and sexually abuse everyone it their cult.”



On the contrary, Catland co-owner and creator of the hex Dakota Bracciale, believes the ritual will be an act of “spiritual solidarity and sociopolitical resistance.” But even before Father Thomas announced his Mass in response to the hex, Bracciale said she not only expected backlash from the Church but sited it as a motivator. “[The hex] strikes fear into the heart of Christian fundamentalists,” Bracciale told Broadly earlier this week. “That’s one of the reasons that we do it. Sometimes you have to fight fire with fire.&quot;

Father Thomas told the the National Catholic Register that he believes witches at the ritual will “direct the evil to have a permanently adverse effect on the Supreme Court justice,&quot; meaning that even if he disagrees with it, Father Thomas at least believes in the power of the hex this weekend. His organized Mass to protect Kavanaugh is set for both tonight and Saturday, the latter being the same day as the hex.
