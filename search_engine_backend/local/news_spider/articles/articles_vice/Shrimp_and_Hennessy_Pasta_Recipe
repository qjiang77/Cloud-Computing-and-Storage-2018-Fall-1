Ingredients

Directions

1 pound|450 grams whole wheat fettuccine3 shallots, minced4 garlic cloves, minced3/4 cup|160 ml Hennessy1/2 tub whipped butter (3/4 cup|112 grams)1 1/2 cups|375 ml heavy cream2 teaspoons|17 grams whole peppercorns3 pounds|1.3 kg jumbo head-on shrimpgarlic powder, to tastedried oregano, to tastekosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste¼ cup|10 grams grated Pecorino-Romano cheese1 ½ teaspoons red chili flakes1 bunch fresh basil, leaves torn, plus leave to garnish

1. Peel and devein the shrimp, saving the shells and the heads. Place the shells and heads in a medium saucepan and cover with 8 cups water. Bring to a simmer, cover, and cook for 10 minutes, then strain.

2. Meanwhile, heat the Hennessy in a large saucepan. Using a lighter, carefully ignite it so it catches fire. Allow the flame to burn out, then add in the butter, garlic, and shallots. Cook until soft, 2 to 3 minutes. Add in the cream and peppercorns and reduce until thick and reduced by half, about 10 minutes. Add in ½ cup of the stock and season with salt and pepper. Season the shrimp with the garlic powder, oregano, salt, and pepper and toss them into the sauce.

3. Bring a large saucepan of generously salted water to a boil. Season with more garlic powder and oregano, then add in the pasta. Cook, stirring, until al dente, 9 minutes. Strain, then toss in the sauce, coating evenly. Add in the cheese, chili flakes, and basil and toss to combine. Serve with more basil on top.
