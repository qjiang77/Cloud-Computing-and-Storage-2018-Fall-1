The ranking measures visitor volume and spend to forecast the growth in visits to those cities in 2018.

This year saw Bangkok retain the top spot from last year, which is unlikely to change due to a strong projected growth of 9.6% this year.

Meanwhile, Dubai came out on top in terms of visitor spending â€” the average visitor spends $537 a day in the Middle Eastern city.
