Ikea announced before the summer that it would be cutting down on staff at Inter Ikea systems – the company that manages IKEA’s brand assets and acts as a franchisor to the IKEA stores owned by the IKEA Group.

As many as 95 out of the 700 employees that were offered to leave have now chosen to accept the deal negotiated between Ikea and union representatives.

The cutbacks are meant to accommodate IKEA’s strategy of increasing focus on online retail going forward. According to union representative Susanna Håkansson that 8till5 spoke with, most employees seem to understand IKEA’s need for organizational change. She also says that many have expressed satisfaction with the deal, which includes compensation corresponding to 12-24 months’ salary depending on age and time at the company.

54 of the 95 are employed in Sweden and 41 are employed in the Netherlands.
