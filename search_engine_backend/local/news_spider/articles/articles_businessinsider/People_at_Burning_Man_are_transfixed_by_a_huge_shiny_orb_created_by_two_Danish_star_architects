This year's Burning Man festival theme was "I, Robot," and two Danish architects caught people's attention with a 100-foot-tall orb on a mast.

The designers of "The ORB" raised $34,300 on Indigogo to get it to the festival in the Nevada desert.

Some people described it as a disco ball, and others as a planet — but it definitely became the crowd favorite.

People in Nevada at the Burning Man festival, which finished on Monday, were transfixed by a huge orb on a mast. "The ORB" has a diameter of 84 feet and stands an impressive 100 feet tall, towering above the dusty venue: Ad

Some people at the festival, the theme of which was "I, Robot," described the shiny sphere as a mini-planet. Its creators, Danish architects Bjarke Ingels and Jakob Lange, have said it's a 1/500,000th-scale model of the Earth's surface.

Before the festival, the designers shared a virtual rendering of the orb on their Indiegogo page:

They wanted to raise $50,000 to get the orb to Burning Man. In the end, they got $34,300, which apparently was enough.

This is what the finished product looked like:

Lange posted the artwork on his Instagram:

But some are content with it being a huge disco ball for festivalgoers:

"The ORB is a tribute to mother earth & human expression — designed to easily inflate and deflate," Lange said on the Indigogo page.
