Tesla CEO Elon Musk was facing an SEC lawsuit last week that would have banned him from serving as a public-company officer, if a court had found him guilty of fraud.

Tesla shares plunged as a result.

After Musk settled over the weekend, Tesla surged on Monday and closed up 17%.

One chart says it all.

Tesla stock has plunged, and Tesla stock has soared.

But rarely has the stock done both in such a short period of time.

From Friday to Monday, Tesla swung from a 15% loss to a 17% percent gain - from $265 to $311.
