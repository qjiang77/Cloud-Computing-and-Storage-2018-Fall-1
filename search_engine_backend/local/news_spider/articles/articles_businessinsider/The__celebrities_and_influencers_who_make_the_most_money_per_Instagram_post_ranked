Influencer marketing is projected to be worth between $5 billion and $10 billion by 2020.

Hopper HQ created an Instagram Rich List of 2018 to highlight the top influencers on the social media app and how much they charge per sponsored post.

Hopper HQ compiled the list using public and private data and contacted every account listed - through a manager, agent, or directly - and requested their fee for sponsored posts.

The Kardashian-Jenner family reigns - four of the sisters made the top 10. Kylie Jenner took the No. 1 spot with a fee of $1 million per post.

Influencer marketing is projected to be worth between $5 and $10 billion by 2020. To determine how much to charge per-post, you need to take into account followers, engagement, status, and audience.

Hopper HQ created an Instagram Rich List of 2018 to highlight the top influencers on the social media app - and how much they charge per sponsored post.

Luckily, the world's biggest celebrities don't have to put in much work building an audience - they can charge six-figure sums from the get-go. Still people who built loyal followings from the ground up - social media influencers - have become celebrities in their own right, commanding anywhere from $1,500 to $33,000 per post.

Hopper HQ categorized influencers in eight core verticals: Celebrity, lifestyle, fitness, sports, beauty, fashion, food, and travel. Hopper HQ compiled the list using public and private data and contacted every account listed - through a manager, agent, or directly - and requested their fee for sponsored posts.

The list was sorted by price for the top-ten influencers in each of the core categories. Travel accounts that exchange posts for free travel instead of a financial return did not make the list.

The 75 influencers below all have one million followers or more and charge $1,300 and up for a sponsored post. Since Hopper HQ released the list, many influencers gained more followers. The follower count on Business Insider's list is as of September 2018.
