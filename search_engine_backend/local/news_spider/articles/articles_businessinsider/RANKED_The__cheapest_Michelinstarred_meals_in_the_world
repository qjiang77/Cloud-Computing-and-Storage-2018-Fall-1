However, this is no longer the case, and there are actually some affordable options if you know where and when to go.

Booking platform Traveloka conducted research into the 50 cheapest Michelin-starred meals in the world— and it found that there are reasonable options all over the planet, starting from just $2.20.

In order to produce the list, the site used the official Michelin website for each country covered by the guide in order to find the cheapest one and two-star restaurants. It then ranked them by the price of an individual meal, whether it was an the cheapest main à la carte dish available or a set menu.

According to Traveloka, a meal at the world's most expensive restaurant — Ibiza's Sublimation — would cost the same as a meal in all 50 of the restaurants on this list combined.
