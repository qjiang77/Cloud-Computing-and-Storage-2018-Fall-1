Janne Käpylehto is a former NASA engineer who describes himself as 'a serial entrepreneur, author and energy expert'. His latest creation is a floating sauna on which he will attempt to sail across the Gulf of Finland to Estonia. The 80 km journey from Helsinki to Tallinn is expected to take nine hours one way, Estonian World reports.

While the sauna is propelled by a motor powered by solar panels, it is heated by a traditional sauna stove. To ensure the success of the voyage, Käpylehto will bring a navigator along as crew, and has also equipped the vessel with a lifeboat.

The inventor has previously made headlines with solar-powered ice carousels. Here's a drone photo from the listing of 'Ice Carousel Island' on Airbnb:
