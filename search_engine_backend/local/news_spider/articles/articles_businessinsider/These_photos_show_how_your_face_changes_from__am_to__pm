"Since I am young, I am fascinated by strangers," she wrote on her website. "While waiting for a bus, while standing in a line, my eyes are always drawn by a specific person. At that exact moment, I can't stop wondering what he is thinking, what he is doing, what are his fears and joys.

"Seven years ago, I decided to embrace this obsession and decided to capture some of these people passing with a camera. I bought a 50mm lens, and simply started asking to take their portrait."

After taking 300 portraits, Iweins decided to photograph 30 of the 300 each year for five years, each time with a different theme.

"7am-7pm," which shows the difference between people's faces in the morning and at night, was her theme in the fourth year of the project.
