President Donald Trump has fallen 138 spots on Forbes' list of the 400 richest people in the US since he launched his presidential campaign in 2015.

Trump's net worth has fallen by roughly $1.4 billion over that time, according to a Forbes report published ahead of the release of its newest "Forbes 400" list.

Over that time, Trump's net worth shrank by roughly $1.4 billion, according to Forbes, which previewed its latest "Forbes 400" list on Tuesday. It had estimated Trump's net worth to be $4.5 billion in 2015. Over the past two years, that number settled to about $3.1 billion, the publication said.

Trump ranked No. 121 on the list in 2015, meaning a 138-position drop would put him at No. 259 this year.

The magazine cited several factors as lowering Trump's net worth, including negative press surrounding his administration that it said had taken a toll on the Trump brand.

Trump's investments in commercial real estate have also taken a hit, in part because of to a boom in e-commerce that has grown exponentially in recent years.

During his 2016 presidential campaign, Trump put out a statement on his net worth instead of releasing his tax returns, sidestepping a longtime tradition in presidential politics.

In the statement, Trump asserted that he had a "massive" net worth "in excess of $10 billion."
