Kimbal Musk said on Tuesday in an interview with Cheddar that Tesla Model 3 customers can likely receive their vehicles by the end of this week if they reach out to the automaker.

"If you have a Model 3 and you'd like it delivered, we can probably get it done for you by the end of this week. If we haven't reached out to you, reach out to us," he said.

Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Earlier this month, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said Tesla's most pressing issues had moved from producing vehicles to delivering them, though he said delivery issues were easier to fix and would be solved soon.

Kimbal Musk is the brother of Tesla CEO Elon Musk and a member of the company's board of directors. When asked about the board's discussions regarding reported investigations from the Securities and Exchange Commission and Department of Justice and investor lawsuits related to Elon's comments in August about taking the company private, Kimbal said he was unable to share the content of the board's discussions, but said "we're doing all the right things," in response to the reported investigations.

Earlier this month, Elon said Tesla's most pressing issues had moved from producing vehicles to delivering them, though he said delivery issues were easier to fix and would be solved soon. He had previously said that some Tesla customers would have to wait longer to get a response from customer service due to a significant increase in vehicle deliveries.

Electrek reported on Monday that the company was offering free deliveries to some Model 3 customers over the weekend. According to the publication, Tesla will continue to offer delivery to some customers in and near Los Angeles throughout the week, though the publication did not say whether the delivery service will be offered elsewhere or whether it will be free.

An email from a Tesla employee to a customer obtained by Business Insider confirmed the existence of the delivery program and indicated deliveries were taking place beyond last weekend.

A new delivery program is notable because the company is approaching the end of its third quarter, which Musk said in September would be the "most amazing quarter" in the company's history. Musk also said that Tesla would build and deliver twice as many cars as it did in the second quarter.
