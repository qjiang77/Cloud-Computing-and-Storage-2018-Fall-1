Chinese construction company China Pacific Construction Group Ltd (CPCG) is planning to make RM10 billion (US$2.4 billion) investments in Malaysia over the next decade, various media outlets reported on Thursday (Oct 11).

The Fortune Global 500 company said these investments would be in line with CPCG’s core business areas of infrastructure development, hi-tech machinery and education.

Founder Yan Jiehe was quoted by The Star as saying that Malaysia was “business friendly, and one of the most competitive countries in the region”.

“The country’s fundamentals are strong. You have excellent infrastructure, a robust eco-system and a big pool of trilingual talents. Kuala Lumpur, is thus, a strategic launch pad for our expansion into Asia Pacific,” he reportedly said.

CPCI plans to hire 150 highly skilled professionals to aid its expansion across the region, The Edge reported.
