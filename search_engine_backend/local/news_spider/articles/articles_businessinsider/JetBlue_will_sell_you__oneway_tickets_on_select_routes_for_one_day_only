This is not the first time this year that JetBlue has offered a promotion based around short-term, low fare flights. In July, the New York-based carrier ran an "Endless Summer Sale" that featured $58 one-way trips to the Caribbean.

The airline made a bold move in August though when they became the first major U.S. carrier to charge $30 for a first checked bag, a move that eventually spurred the other major domestic airlines to raise their fees to the same level.
