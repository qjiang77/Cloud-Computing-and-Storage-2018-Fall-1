That is, at least, according to a recent study by CandyStore.com, an online retailer that sells candy in bulk across the United States and Canada.

CandyStore.com's study looked at sales data from 2007 to 2017 to find each state's favorite candy in the months leading up to Halloween. Sales were broken down by state and then verified by CandyStore.com's distributors.

This year, the National Retail Federation is estimating that shoppers will spend $2.6 billion on Halloween candy, which is slightly lower than last year's estimate of $2.7 billion. That's equal to about $27 spent on candy per person.

According to CandyStore.com, the top sellers nationwide were Skittles, M&M's, and Snickers.

Take a look at which candy is most popular in your state.
