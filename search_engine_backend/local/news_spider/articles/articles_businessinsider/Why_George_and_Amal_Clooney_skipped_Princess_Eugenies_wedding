Amal was giving a keynote speech at the Pennsylvania Conference for Women. It's unknown why George didn't attend the wedding, but he and Brooksbank know each other through Casamigos, George's tequila company, which he cofounded with Rande Gerber.

Brooksbank is the company's European brand manager.

A spokesperson from the tequila brand told INSIDER that a selection of bespoke Casamigos cocktails would be served to guests throughout the wedding weekend.

Other celebrities, including Cara Delevingne and Naomi Campbell, were in attendance at the ceremony.

The Clooneys did attend the royal wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in May, where George reportedly poured shots of his own tequila behind the bar of the after-party.
