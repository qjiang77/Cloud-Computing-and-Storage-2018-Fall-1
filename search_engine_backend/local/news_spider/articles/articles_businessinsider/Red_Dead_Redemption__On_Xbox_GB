Red Dead Redemption 2 On Xbox: 88.57GB|https://www.businessinsider.com.au|https://www.kotaku.com.au/2018/10/red-dead-redemption-2-on-xbox-88-57gb/|Australian Stories,rockstar games,red dead redemption 2,Latest Deals|2018-10-15|James Whitbrook,Brian Ashcraft||It's not as bad as the PSA on the back of the Red Dead Redemption 2 PS4 Pro bundle, but if you're headed to the Wild West on Xbox One you're still going to need almost 90GB to get started.

A listing on the Microsoft Store has revealed the file size for RDR 2 on Microsoft's platform. While it's not in the triple figures, be warned. If you're not buying this game at retail, you'll need a good chunk of space.

On the bright side, there's not much incentive to buy digital for games like this when the retail deals are substantially better. Most major retailers are targeting the $69 mark, which is miles better than paying almost $100 for the standard edition through the Microsoft Store. Plus, you hopefully won't have to download quite so much, which is a blessing for anyone without the NBN/cable internet.
