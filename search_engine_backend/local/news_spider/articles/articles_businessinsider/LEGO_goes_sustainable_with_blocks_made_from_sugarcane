LEGO wants the majority of its production to be sustainable by 2030.

On August 1st it launched its first sustainable LEGO-bricks.

The new bricks are made of sugarcane plastic and are shaped as plants.

The Danish toymaker LEGO has high ambitions for its sustainability program. By 2030, the company intends to produce the majority of its products and packaging from environmentally friendly materials or recycled sources.

In 2018, the company took its first step towards these goals by introducing plastic blocks made of plant-based materials – in the shape of plants. The company announced the introduction of sustainable LEGO blocks in March this year.

From August 1, they are available to customers from selected countries. The 'Plants from Plants' set number 40320 will be included free of charge for all purchases over EUR 35 from the official LEGO online store in the United Kingdom, Germany, and Austria (in the period of August 1-17), as well as in the United States and Canada (in the period of August 1-14). Elements of the set will also appear in other sets of blocks during 2018, Business Insider Polska reports.

LEGO’s new blocks are 98% polyethylene, which is made from sugar cane. The material use of sugarcane plastic is in line with the guidelines of LEGO's partner World Wildlife Fund (WWF). Even if they come from vegetable soures LEGO blocks are still not biodegradable.

"At the LEGO Group we want to make a positive impact on the world around us, and are working hard to make great play products for children using sustainable materials," said Tim Brooks, Vice President, Environmental Responsibility at the LEGO Group, in March.
