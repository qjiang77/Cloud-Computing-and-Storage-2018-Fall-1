The NOLLA cabin is a new prototype for zero emission housing. This cabin can be erected anywhere and is designed and manufactured by the Finnish renewable energy company Neste.

With the cabin, that currently is located in the Finnish archipelago, the company starts its ‘Journey to Zero’ – a future of minimal emissions. The cabin is designed to bring its visitors closer to nature and inspires them to live with a minimal emission footprint.

NOLLA is built out of the local Finnish material Kerto LVL, which was a conscious decision to ensure both comfortability and durability. Since the material is made of wood, it acts as a carbon sink throughout its life cycle.

The energy supply of the cabin is entirely fossil-free, derived only from renewable energy sources, like solar panels on the roof.

The interior of the cabin is also made out of sustainable and local materials with items from the Stockmann Sustainable Collection.
