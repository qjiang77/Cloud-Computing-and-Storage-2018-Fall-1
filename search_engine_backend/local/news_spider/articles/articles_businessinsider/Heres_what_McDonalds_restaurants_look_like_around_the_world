McDonald’s operates more than 36,000 restaurants around the world.

The menu varies to reflect the local cuisine of the country where it’s located.

The stores themselves vary in appearance, too. Though many international McDonald’s locations look similar to its US stores, some locations are completely unique.

See what McDonald’s restaurants look like around the world.

McDonald’s operates more than 36,000 restaurants in more than 100 countries around the world.

Many of the McDonald’s restaurants around the world look similar to the ones we see in the US, but the menus vary to reflect the local cuisine of the country the restaurant is in.

But some McDonald’s locations stand out from the rest. Around the world, there are high-end McDonald’s with marble walls and chandeliers, McDonald’s in historic buildings, and even a McDonald’s on a ski slope.

In countries like Spain and Italy, McDonald’s serves pastries like macarons. And in Rome, McDonald’s has a gelato bar.

See what other McDonald’s restaurants are like around the world:

The exterior is white wood paneling, and the golden arches are a bit more subtle than at McDonald’s restaurants in the US …

… but the inside is pretty similar to what McDonald’s looks like in the US.

The menu isn’t especially different, either.

This location in Madrid, Spain, is not your average McDonalds. It has a grand staircase and marble walls, and the architecture blends in with the buildings around it.

Downstairs is a seating area with marble floors and chandeliers …

… and upstairs is a second seating area that feels more high-end than your typical McDonald’s.

It has digital-ordering kiosks …

… and it serves pastries like macarons.

The menu looks pretty different from your typical McDonald’s …

… just look what it calls a Quarter Pounder …

… and it sells pastries like macarons.

It even has a case of cookies, cakes, doughnuts, and other desserts.

It also has a gelato counter.

In Porto, Portugal, a historic building from the 1930s that was once known as the Imperial Cafe is now home to a McDonald’s.

It has Art Deco stained glass, high ceilings …

… and chandeliers hanging down over the spacious dining room. It’s definitely more high-end than your typical McDonald’s.
