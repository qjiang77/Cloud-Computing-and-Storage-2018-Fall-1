The 75-year-old has yet to declare his intentions to run in the next presidential election, but there have been strong hints that he will challenge President Donald Trump in two years.

The Democratic field is expected to be one of the largest ever. Respondents were questioned about their preference for 16 potential candidates in the poll. Biden came out on top, but garnered only 33% of the vote.

He is followed by Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who is the favored candidate among 13% of respondents, and Sen. Kamala Harris of California, who 9% of respondents favored.

Among some of the longshots on the list are Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Michael Avenatti, who gained fame as porn star Stormy Daniels' attorney.

The poll also asked respondents whether they think Trump will win re-election or not, and the results were split: 46% said they think he'll win in 2020, while 47% said they think he will lose.

Here's the full results:
