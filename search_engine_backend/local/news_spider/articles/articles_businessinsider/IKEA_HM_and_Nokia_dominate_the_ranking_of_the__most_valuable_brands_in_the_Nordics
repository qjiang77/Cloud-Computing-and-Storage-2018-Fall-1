IKEA defends last year’s position as the most valuable brand in the Nordics.

Here are the highlights from the top 20:

Sweden

Overall, the Swedish giants are overrepresented in the top, with 11 out of the top 20 most valuable brands being from Sweden. Number two on the list, clinging hard to its placement since last year, is the former highest valued publicly traded firm in Sweden – H&M.

Finland

Finland is represented by no more than one – but just as proud – giant, Nokia. Since last year the now fully network-focused corporation has entered the top three, growing its brand value by an astonishing 63%.

Norway

The fourth place on the list goes to the Nordics' largest firm Equinor, formerly Statoil. Having been Norway’s most valuable brand in the past will likely help as they are re-branding the corporation towards becoming a broader energy firm.

Denmark

Denmark is represented by five very different firms, the highest ranked being Lego, in fifth place. Other top-ranked companies are shipping colossus Maersk and Danske Bank.

Earning the title as the fastest growing brand in Denmark is Nykredit which managed to achieve an upswing of 41% in brand value since last year.

Here are the Nordics' 20 most valuable brands, according to Brand Finance:
