The latest interpretation of Igor Stravinskij’s ballet ‘The Rite of Spring’ has the potential to become a classic.





An industrial robot plays a lead role at Kulturhuset Stadsteatern in collaboration with the Swedish industrial company ABB.

Henrik “Benke” Rydman, who will be the only human on stage, has been rehearsing a “completely new dance to interpret a meeting between man and technology”, writes ABB in a press release.

His dancing partner IRB 6620 is designed for welding and material handling in industries, but will demonstrate its skills in a completely new setting. For ABB, the performance is a way to showcase their software product SafeMove2, which enables robots to safely coexist in the same space as humans.

“People work much closer in the modern manufacturing process, and it is not efficient to turn off the robots each time a worker comes near,” says Dennis Helfridson, Vice President Robotics Sweden at ABB.

“Our customers are interested in solutions with high standards of safety and productivity. This performance aims to show how we move into a new era with more interaction between robots and humans in an imaginative way.”

The premiere is set for September 7th at Kulturhuset Stadsteatern in Stockholm, Sweden, and around 40 performances are scheduled until November 30th.
