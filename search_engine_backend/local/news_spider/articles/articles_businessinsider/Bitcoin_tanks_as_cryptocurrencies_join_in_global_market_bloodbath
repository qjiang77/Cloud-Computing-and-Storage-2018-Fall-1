Cryptocurrencies across the board are nursing big losses on Thursday as the global market sell-off hitting traditional assets spreads.

Bitcoin, the benchmark cryptocurrency, dropped suddenly and sharply in Asian trading overnight, losing as much as 7%, before rebounding a little.

It is now holding at a loss of around 5% on the day, trading at $6,266 per coin.
