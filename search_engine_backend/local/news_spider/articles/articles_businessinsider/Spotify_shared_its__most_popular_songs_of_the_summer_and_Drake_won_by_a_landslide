Spotify has shared a list of the songs its global users listened to the most in summer 2018.

Drake, unsurprisingly, tops the list with his ubiquitous Billboard No. 1 single "In My Feelings," which went viral earlier this summer on the strength of a video dance challenge that Will Smith ended up participating in.

Spotify said its listeners streamed "In My Feelings" 393 million times between June 1 and August 20.

Maroon 5's Cardi B collaboration ""Girls Like You" came in a distant second place with 293 million streams during the same period.

Rounding out the list are tracks from the likes of Calvin Harris, Post Malone, and the late rapper Xxxtentaction.
