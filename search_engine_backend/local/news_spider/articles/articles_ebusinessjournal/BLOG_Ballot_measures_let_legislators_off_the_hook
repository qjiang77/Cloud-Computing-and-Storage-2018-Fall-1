This coming Nov. 6 California voters will have nearly a dozen ballot propositions to weigh in on.

In my opinion, that’s nearly a dozen too many.

It’s not that I don’t support the end goal of some of these ballot measures. I’m all for Proposition 6, which would repeal the fuel tax and vehicle fee increase.

It’s just that it’s too easy for deep-pocketed special interest groups to place these measures on a ballot, and they are often worded in very confusing ways, leaving voters in the dark on what they are actually voting for.

They also play to people’s emotions. The Nov. 6 ballot includes measures that would issue $1.5 billion in bonds for children’s hospitals and $4 billion for affordable housing programs for low-income residents. It’s hard to cast a “no” vote against these measures without feeling like a Grinch. They would fund noble goals, but how are we supposed to pay for them?

Ballot propositions leave our lawmakers in Sacramento off the hook for doing their job. Let’s leave the legislation to the legislators, and block special interests from manipulating our electorate to serve their own goals.
