Winter traveling may become easier as Fresno Yosemite International Airport airlines will increase flights.

Between November and January 2019, four carriers will add to the number of trips abroad, according to a press release from the airport. The addition of Frontier Airlines earlier this year also means more trips compared to last year.

“The Airport has experienced a continuous increase in travelers year-round and it is anticipated that the upcoming holiday travel period may be our busiest winter season,” said Director of Aviation Kevin Meikle. “We are pleased that our airline partners have committed to adding flights and seat capacity to connect travelers to their destinations over the peak holiday travel periods.”

Alaska Airlines is adding a fourth daily departure to Seattle and twice daily service to Portland, Oregon. A third daily flight to San Diego will also be scheduled.

American Airlines will be making the route between Fresno and Dallas, Texas three times a day. On select days, there will be a fourth flight.

Volaris will double the amount of trips to Guadalajara, Mexico to twice daily flights on select days all the way through January of next year. The airline already offers twice weekly flights to Morelia, Mexico. AeroMexico will send planes to Guadalajara on a daily basis into the new year. Between the two carriers, flights to Mexico will double.

Fresno Yosemite International makes nonstop trips to Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Portland, Salt Lake City, San Diego, San Francisco, Seattle and Guadalajara and Morelia in Mexico.
