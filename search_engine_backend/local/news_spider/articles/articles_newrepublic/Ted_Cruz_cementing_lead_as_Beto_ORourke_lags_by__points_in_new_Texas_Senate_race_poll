WASHINGTON — A new poll released Thursday morning showed Sen. Ted Cruz maintaining a solid lead over Rep. Beto O'Rourke in the race for the U.S. Senate.

With just less than four weeks to go before Election Day, the Quinnipiac University Poll showed Cruz ahead by 9 percentage points — the same lead Quinnipiac found in a survey of likely Texas voters three weeks ago, suggesting O'Rourke's momentum has stalled and Cruz's risk is fading.

The nine-point edge in last month's polls was by far the largest the senator had enjoyed in months and stood out as a potential outlier after a summer of polls showing a much closer contest. The next day, a Reuters/Ipsos survey showed O'Rourke ahead by 2 points.

The wide range of results has kept campaigns and pundits guessing.

Cruz's pollster has questioned the methodology and results of polls showing the challenger fighting to a tie. But the incumbent's campaign has routinely cited the close race to tamp down potentially fatal complacency. On Sunday, Cruz blasted out a donor email warning of a "2 point race."

That may be a tougher sell now, with pressure mounting on O'Rourke to turn his stockpile of cash and adoring throngs into votes.

"Is the Beto bubble bursting or just hissing away with a slow leak? ... Beto O'Rourke has hit a wall,"

said Peter Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll. "The election is far from over, but Sen. Cruz would have to suffer a major collapse for him to lose."
