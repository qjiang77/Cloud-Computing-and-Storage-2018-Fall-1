Blackburn Has 8-Point Lead Over Bredesen, CBS News Poll Finds|http://www.newrepublic.com/minutes|https://www.newschannel5.com/news/election/congressional-races/blackburn-has-8-point-lead-over-bredesen-cbs-poll-finds||2018-10-08|||NASHVILLE, Tenn. - A new poll from CBS News indicates that Congressman Marsha Blackburn has an eight-point lead over former Tennessee Governor Phil Bredesen in Tennessee's U.S. Senate race.

The closely-watched race could impact which party has a majority in the Senate. Both are running to replace outgoing Sen. Bob Corker.

“Tennessee finds Republican Marsha Blackburn with an eight-point lead over Democrat Phil Bredesen, 50-42. Bredesen is a former governor who, having won statewide office before, has given Democrats hope of flipping a red state that Mr. Trump won easily,” according to CBS News.

On Sunday, Tennessee-native, Taylor Swift – who for the most part, has stayed out of the political spotlight during her career – posted to Instagram announcing her support for Bredesen and Representative Jim Cooper.
