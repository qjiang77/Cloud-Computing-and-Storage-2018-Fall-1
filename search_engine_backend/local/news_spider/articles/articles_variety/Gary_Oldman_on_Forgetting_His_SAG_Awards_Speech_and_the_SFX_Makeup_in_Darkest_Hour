Gary Oldman on Forgetting His SAG Awards Speech and the SFX Makeup in 'Darkest Hour'|http://www.variety.com/videos|https://variety.com/video/gary-oldman-darkest-hour-sag-awards-speech-sfx-makeup/||2018-02-05|Variety Staff||Star Gary Oldman and special effects makeup artist Kazuhiro Tsuji joined the Variety Screening Series presented by Filmstruck to discuss “Darkest Hour.”

Oldman brought Tsuji out of retirement for the task of transforming him into Winston Churchill. “I worked with some horrible actors and that made me leave, but I never had any opportunity to work on a great movie with a great actor,” Tsuji says of agreeing to the job, which he refers to as a “dream project.”

His SAG Award win left him “truly floored,” Oldman says. He prepared a few words since he was nominated “because it would be rude not to,” he adds.

“I got up there, and of course it all went out of my head,” he recalls. “I just got very emotional.”
