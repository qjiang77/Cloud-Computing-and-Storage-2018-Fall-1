Dwayne Johnson's 'Skyscraper' Gets Explosive First Trailer|http://www.variety.com/videos|https://variety.com/video/dwayne-johnson-skyscraper-first-trailer/||2018-02-05|Variety Staff||The trailer for Dwayne Johnson’s new film “Skyscraper” looks like a bad time for the residents of the world’s tallest and most advanced building.

“The Pearl is the tallest and most advanced building in the world,” Johnson’s character explains. “You’ve built a vertical city, but you’ve brought with it every safety and security challenge that I can think of. Not only have you brought them all indoors, but you’ve trapped them 240 floors in the air.”

“Skyscraper” follows war veteran turned security assessor Will Ford (Johnson) examining the tallest, safest building in the world when it catches on fire and he finds himself framed for the incident.

The action flick opens July 13.
