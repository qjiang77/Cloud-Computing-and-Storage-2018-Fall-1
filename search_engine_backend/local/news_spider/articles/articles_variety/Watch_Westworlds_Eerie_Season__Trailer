In the preview, a calm, serene scene is presented, promising “a beautiful world” as horses run through the countryside.

“We built this world together, a world where dreams come true. A world where you can be free,” Dolores narrates, before suggesting, “This world is a lie. This world deserves to die because this is your world. We’ve lived by your rules long enough. We can save this world, we can burn it to the ground and from the ashes build a new world: our world,” alongside scenes from the new season.

The trailer also reveals the second season will debut on April 22.
