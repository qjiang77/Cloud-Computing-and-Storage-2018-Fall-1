Regina King Says Men Can Help Fight for Women's Rights|http://www.variety.com/videos|https://variety.com/video/regina-king-womens-rights-men/||2018-10-09|Variety Staff||To truly succeed, Regina King says people need to stop seeing others as competition.

“A flower just blooms, it doesn’t try to outbloom the other flower,” she says. “I think we get so consumed with what someone likes about another, instead of just kind of focusing on, ‘You’re pretty fantastic in your own skin.’ The world needs to see your fantasticness.”

The actress and director, who recently won the lead actress in a limited series Emmy for Netflix’s “Seven Seconds” says she is inspired by everyone from Betty White to her own son, and that it’s also important to have role models who show her “what I don’t want to be.” King also says she wants to be a role model to others, and works with the “I Have A Dream” Foundation, to empower children and give them more resources to succeed.

With the one-year anniversary of Time’s Up and the reinvigorated #MeToo movement coming up, King says it’s important men know they have a part in the fight for female empowerment.

“We still need men to know that while this is a time where we are being very vocal about what we’re missing and standing up for ourselves, we still need them to know that we love them and want them by our side being vocal along with us, and being open about those things that you love about us.”
