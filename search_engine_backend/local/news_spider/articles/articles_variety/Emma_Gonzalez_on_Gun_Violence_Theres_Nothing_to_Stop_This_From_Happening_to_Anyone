Emma Gonzalez on Gun Violence: 'There's Nothing to Stop This From Happening to Anyone'|https://variety.com|https://variety.com/video/emma-gonzalez-power-of-women-speech/||2018-10-12|Nate Nickolai||Emma Gonzalez was moved to tears while discussing gun violence in America during her speech at Variety‘s Power of Women event presented by Lifetime.

Eight months after the Parkland shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, Gonzalez said she can still feel the pain she felt that day as if it’s happening right now.

“Nothing made sense in those days, except for the fact that there was nothing to stop this from happening to anyone in a country with practically no gun safety laws,” she said.

Gonzalez also called upon the audience to use their platforms to take a stand against violence and to encourage more people to vote.

“Everybody in this room is in a unique position because you are here, you have proven to hold power,” Gonzalez said. “To each of you powerful women I say this, you know that you are forces to be reckoned with, you can and have inspired peace and understanding and most importantly right now you can inspire your audience to vote. Now more than ever women need to continue to rise up.”
