The panel was comprised of Salim Akil (“Black Lightning”), Joel Fields (“The Americans”), Soo Hugh (“The Terror”), Raamla Mohamed (“Scandal”), Chris Mundy (“Ozark”), George Pelecanos (“The Deuce”), Matthew Roberts (“Outlander”), Sarah Gertrude Shapiro (“UnReal”), David Shore (“The Good Doctor”), Krista Vernoff (“Grey’s Anatomy”), Ayanna Floyd Davis (“The Chi”), Maggie Cohn (“The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story”), and Jessica Queller (“Supergirl”).

In providing more inclusive writers’ rooms, Akil urged that, “diversity is not diversity for the sake of filling quotas,” he said. “We’re not doing anyone any favors when we talk about the idea of inclusion. It’s good business.”
