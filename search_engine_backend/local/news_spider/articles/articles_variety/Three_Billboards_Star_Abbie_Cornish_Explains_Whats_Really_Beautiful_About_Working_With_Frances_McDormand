Rockwell, Cornish, and Britt-Gibson all showered praise on star Frances McDormand, who’s up for the best actress prize (and widely seen as a frontrunner) at the Academy Awards.

“What’s beautiful about Frances is she’s so involved in what she’s doing and she’s so there. And so much work has led up to that, and the same to be said of you,” Cornish said, pointing to Rockwell. “So much work leads up to that moment that that moment does become free, you know? And that’s really beautiful about working with someone like Frances.”
