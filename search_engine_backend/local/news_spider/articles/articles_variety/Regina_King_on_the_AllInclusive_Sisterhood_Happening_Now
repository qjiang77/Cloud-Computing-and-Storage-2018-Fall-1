Regina King on the 'All-Inclusive Sisterhood' Happening Now|http://www.variety.com/videos|https://variety.com/video/regina-king-i-wouldnt-be-standing-here-today-without-a-strong-support-system/||2018-10-12|Margeaux Sippell||“Civility, respect, the ability to make a difference in someone’s life by supporting or lifting them up are qualities I don’t take lightly,” Regina King said at Variety‘s annual Power of Women event presented by Lifetime, held Friday at the Beverly Wilshire Four Seasons Hotel in Beverly Hills, Calif.

“I don’t take them lightly because I wouldn’t be standing here today if I didn’t have a lifetime of family, friends, and colleagues who have and continue to do the same for me,” she continued. “I wouldn’t be standing here right now if I didn’t have a mother who encouraged me and my sister to dream beyond the sky.”

King went on to emphasize the importance of women supporting other women.

“There is an all-inclusive sisterhood that’s happening right now. Women are supporting, loving, and protecting each other outwardly on a grand scale,” she said. “It’s a beautiful thing, and it makes my heart smile. And that is powerful.”
