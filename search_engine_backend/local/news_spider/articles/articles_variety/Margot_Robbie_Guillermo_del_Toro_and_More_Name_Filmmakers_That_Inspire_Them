Robbie says she admired Goldie Hawn growing up. “I love her physical comedy,” Robbie says. “She’s so charismatic on screen.”

Alfred Hitchcock was one of del Toro’s biggest influences, while Nanjiani says del Toro is one of his favorite directors.

“The Big Sick” co-writer Emily V. Gordon chose Spike Lee. “I like anything that causes me to shift my perspective on the world,” she says.
