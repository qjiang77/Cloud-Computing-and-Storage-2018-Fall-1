The panel was comprised of Rachel Bloom (“Crazy Ex-Girlfriend”), Stephen Glover (“Atlanta”), Michael Schur (“The Good Place”), Tanya Saracho (“Vida”), Peter Farrelly (“Loudermilk”), Gloria Calderon Kellett (“One Day at a Time”), Davey Holmes (“Get Shorty”), Laura Jacqmin (“Get Shorty”), Judd Apatow (“Crashing”), Andrea Savage (“I’m Sorry”), Gemma Baker (“Mom”), Jennie Snyder Urman (“Jane the Virgin”), and Carly Mensch (“GLOW”).

On how to make writers’ rooms more inclusive, Snyder Urman noted how “we give paternity leaves and we give long ones. It’s just a different environment than lots of shows that are comedies. Sometimes we’ll have meetings where we cry, and we’re like: ‘It’s okay.’”
