Natalie Portman Says She Doesn't Sleep After Kavanaugh Confirmation|https://variety.com|https://variety.com/video/natalie-portman-power-of-women-speech-kavanaugh/||2018-10-12|Margeaux Sippell||Ever since Brett Kavanaugh was confirmed to the Supreme Court, Natalie Portman has had trouble sleeping.

“My son asked me the other day why it looked like I’d been wearing goggles,” Portman told the crowd at Variety‘s annual Power of Women event presented by Lifetime.

“Baby,” she told him, “Kavanaugh. I don’t sleep.”

Portman went on to emphasize the problem with demonizing female rage.

“Stop the rhetoric that a woman is crazy or difficult,” Portman insisted. “If a man says a woman is crazy or difficult, ask him, ‘What bad thing did you do to her?’ That’s a code word. He is trying to discredit her reputation,” she said.

She continued, “If any group you are part of only has people that look like you, change that group. Be embarrassed if everyone in your workplace looks like you.”
