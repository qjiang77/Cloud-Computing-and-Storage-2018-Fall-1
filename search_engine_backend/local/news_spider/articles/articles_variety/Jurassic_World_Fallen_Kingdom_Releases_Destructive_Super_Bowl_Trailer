The new clip shows massive destruction across the island of Isla Nublar as buildings explode and lava flows. “Jurassic World, the island, all of that is in the past,” says a narrator. “I want to show you the future.”

The film stars Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard, Justice Smith, James Cromwell, and Toby Jones. It’s directed by J.A. Bayona and will release June 22.
