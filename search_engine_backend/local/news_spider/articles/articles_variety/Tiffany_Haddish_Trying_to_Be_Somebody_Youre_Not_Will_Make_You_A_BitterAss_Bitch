Tiffany Haddish: Trying to Be Somebody You're Not Will Make You 'A Bitter-Ass Bitch'|https://variety.com|https://variety.com/video/tiffany-haddish-bitter-ass-bitch/||2018-10-12|Rachel Yang||The message to “be yourself” was the core of Tiffany Haddish’s speech at Variety’s Power of Women, presented by Lifetime. The “Girls Trip” star said she was “not sorry” to be so honest and praised fellow honoree Lena Waithe for being unapologetic about her identity. Even Haddish’s charity, the Unusual Suspects Theatre Company, encourages children to express their true selves.

“I feel like it’s very important to always be your best self and be yourself, and try not to be something you’re not,” Haddish said at the annual luncheon held at the Beverly Wilshire Four Seasons Hotel in Beverly Hills, Calif. “Because that’s when you become a bitter-ass bitch, when you being somebody you not. People are like, ‘Does she got an attitude?’ — no, you’re trying to be yourself but you can’t because you’ve been lying for so long.”
