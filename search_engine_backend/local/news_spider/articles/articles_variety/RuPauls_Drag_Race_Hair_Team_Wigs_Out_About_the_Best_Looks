'RuPaul's Drag Race' Hair Team Wigs Out About the Best Looks|http://www.variety.com/videos|https://variety.com/video/rupauls-drag-race-wigs-best-looks/||2018-08-23|Tara Bitran||When “RuPaul’s Drag Race” hair department head Gabriel Villarreal was in beauty school, his teacher was obsessed with teasing wigs.

“She’d say, ‘Okay, well, let me get my rat tail comb.’ And she would stab it inside the wig and she would pick it up. And if she shook it and it did not fall off, it was teased enough,'” Villarreal recalls on the set of the hit reality series.

Speaking to Variety’s Marc Malkin, Villarreal said when he was a contestant on the show, “I can remember being more intrigued with what was happening behind the scenes than what was happening in the challenges.”

Since joining the production staff, he considers RuPaul’s Season 10 promo wig his favorite: “I said, ‘Let’s do something white. She’s never had a white wig for a promo. And let’s also do red lipstick because those minor little things together with the catsuit are still on the ‘Ru’ brand. That’s always the thing.”

Head hair stylist Hector Pocasangre said when it comes to beauty tools, he always has a rat tail comb, Mason Pearson brush, and can of hairspray on hand. “I’ve done every type of look on the show. I’ve been here since Season 1,” he reminisces.

Villarreal says when returning for a new season of “RuPaul,” “you have to be able to say, ‘I definitely see a progression.’ Or else you’re not doing your job. And you always know if you’re on target when she looks at it and says, ‘I’m ready.'”
