With heat styling, chemical and colour treatments as well as the country’s weather conditions all taking a toll on our hair, there is an urgent need for products that can restore our locks back to health – adding moisture and shine, without more chemicals. Fortunately, the BioSilk hair care range has dropped in SA, giving South Africans with all hair types access to high quality and affordable tools and products infused with silk to transform their tresses. Available in selected Clicks stores across the country and from Glamit.co.za, BioSilk cares for and repairs hair strand by strand.

BioSilk products are also alcohol, silicone, chemical, paraben, sulphate, and cruelty-free. They are made from natural ingredients and are designed to nourish, protect and repair hair using the power of silk.

Best of all, BioSilk is available in three ranges, with one to suit every hair type.
