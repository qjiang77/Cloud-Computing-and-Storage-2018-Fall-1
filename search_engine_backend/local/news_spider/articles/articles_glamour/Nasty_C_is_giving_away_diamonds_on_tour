The Strings and Bling rapper took to Instagram to announce that he would be giving away custom diamonds on his upcoming Ivyson Tour.

‘So what do I have to do to win?’, you might be asking yourself. Well, it’s simple, really. Just do your best Nasty C impression, make sure that you show off your ticket to the Ivyson Tour in the video clip, tag Nasty C and @Shohrehcustomade, and you could be walking away with some custom ice, courtesy of the young star and Dr Smile (our fave Dentist/Musician/Jeweller).
