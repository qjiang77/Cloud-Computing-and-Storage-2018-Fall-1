Refresh your summer wardrobe with Karen Millen|http://www.glamour.co.za|https://www.glamour.co.za/2018/09/summer-wardrobe-karen-millen-update/|update,Karen Millen,workwear,Trends,Shop,fashion|2018-09-19|September||Looking to update your summer workwear wardrobe? Tired of wearing the same old pantsuit you purchased for that interview? Well, the SS18 Karen Millen collection sees workwear re-imagined to embrace powerful femininity with contemporary silhouettes and considered fabrications.

The womenswear is doing tailoring the 2018 way.

Think shirts re-invented – tied, wrapped, draped, belted and embroidered – while trousers come wide, tapered, sporty or cropped. Suiting showcases the true atelier ethos with razor-sharp cuts, cinched waists and corsetry details allowing for a dramatic silhouette. Colour and print add a new dimension – crisp white and black sit-back with neutral pinstripes and stylized micro-florals. Sports-luxe influences can be seen across languid shapes and easy styling pieces in a colour palette of cream, navy and mustard.

And they don’t only offer fresh workwear but occasion wear as well.

Bold unabashed femininity is embodied in the evening and occasion wear. From crisp white tailoring and figure-sculpting midis, each piece oozes allure. Dresses are mini, midi, maxi; fitted, fluid and structured, complete with graphic embellishment, cut-outs, striking palettes and cinched waists. Polka-dots play a key role, adding an air of fun and flirtation to a monochrome colour pallet.
