Today, 11 October is International Coming Out Day, and The Thami Dish Foundation has curated Africa’s first Global LGBTIQ+ Network Conference that perfectly collides with this day at the Constitution Hill in Johannesburg. The three-day conference launched on 10 October is on until 12 October. Justice Edwin Cameron, writer Siya Khumalo, and activist Ricki Kgositau are among the speakers at the conference with media personality Sadie Giliiberti, as the programme director. The aim is to create a unified global voice, champion issue-based responses, advocacy, and interventions around matters pertaining to the LGBTIQ+ community.

Musician, photographer and entrepreneur Aya Zungu and poet, film-maker and photographer Blunt Moya’s #ClosetIsForClothes, is a piercing and thought-provoking photo exhibition that is currently showing in conjunction with the conference.

The exhibition zooms in on issues and challenges faced by the LGBTIQ+ community. It tackles issues of identity, same-sex attraction, and intimacy while highlighting social ills such as hate crimes and gender-based violence.

Here’s a sneak peek of some of the images from the exhibition:
