Cassie Ventura and Diddy split in memes|http://www.glamour.co.za|https://www.glamour.co.za/2018/10/memes-sean-diddy-combs-and-cassie-ventura-split/|P.Diddy,Celebrity News,Cassie Ventura,celeb news|2018-10-18|October||Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs and Cassie Ventura have reportedly split, after six confirmed years together, although they are speculated to have started dating in 2007.

The 48-year-old rapper went public with his relationship with Cassie in 2012 after years of speculation, but it now seems the pair have called it quits as sources say they hope to “remain friends” despite no longer being together.

An insider told People magazine: “The decision was amicable and they remain friends. Cassie is going to focus on her music and acting career.”

Shortly after the news broke last night, Black Twitter flooded our feeds with the funniest memes. One side of the Twitterverse sympathized with Cassie because she spent 11 years with the rapper, and walked away without a ring or a ‘severance package!’ Whilst the other camp just poked fun at how trifling Diddy is (as it is suspected that he has already moved on with a 26-year-old Cassie lookalike).

Take a look at the Cassie and Diddy memes that had us in stitches last night.
