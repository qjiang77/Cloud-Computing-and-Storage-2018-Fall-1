And, by joining us at the GLAMOUR Hair Masterclass, in partnership with Frika, you’ll find out how to create Insta-worthy looks that’ll have everyone’s eyes on you.

Turn to the runway and be inspired to rock a variety of chic hairdos, when you admire them in our hair show. See all the hairstyles that Frika is famed for, such as dramatic Rapunzel-like braids. Plus, three of Frika’s top stylists will each show you how to create a different hairdo, during their captivating classes.

Then, you’ll have the chance to put your own skills to the test! You can recreate the three hairdos when you take part in the demo, by styling the hair of a mannequin. The stylists will also host a Q&A session so that you get all the info you need to slay your hairstyling game.

To add to the fun, you can indulge in a selection of finger foods and refreshing drinks that’ll make your mouth water. If you think you’ll leave empty-handed, think again! You’ll be treated to a goodie bag filled with luxe spoils.
