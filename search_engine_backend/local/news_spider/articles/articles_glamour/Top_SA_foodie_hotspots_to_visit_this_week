Joburg

Marble

19 Keyes Ave, Trumpet on Keyes, Rosebank; 010 594 5550

The name is a nod to truly top-notch meat (the more ‘marbling’, the better the cut), and with Chef David Higgs at the helm, this ultra high-end spot is all about the best. Stand-

outs include the signature ribeye (R285) and the sirloin (R275). Then try the Strawberry – burnt strawberry, strawberry jelly, lemon sponge and white chocolate crème (R95).

Sphere Monk

24 Albrecht St, Jeppestown; 081 392 3726

A great fine food addition to the trendy Maboneng Precinct, this eatery draws a sexy crowd with it’s confident, modern twist on classic dishes, as well as live jazz. Chef Liam Bloy worked at the two-star Michelin Didier de Courten and Joburg’s acclaimed Cube before and shows off his skills with creations like the smoked salmon, avocado, and butter-poached root vegetables (R200), and mango and passion fruit sorbet with deconstructed cheesecake (R80).

Cape Town

Marrow

83 Loop St, CBD; 082 963 3534

Minimalist, contemporary and the first of its kind in SA, this inviting broth bar is inspired by the global trend for Asian soups. Get in on the wholesome wave with a choice of clear, brown, green or white broth (R30), or try yours with a fresh and tasty topping like roast chicken, chorizo, spring onion and julienne carrots (R65).

Firefish

Shop 154, Victoria Wharf, V&A Waterfront; 021 286 4933

This luxe seafood restaurant is made for romantic splurges – book an outside table for great harbour views. Crispy prawns (R120) are a zesty starter, and pan-fried seabass in Champagne and yuzu-miso sauce (R280) is a great main. To end? Say yes to chocolate macaron pie (R80).

Durban

Republik, Hillcrest

50 Old Main Rd, The Colony Centre, Hillcrest; 082 877 4614

Craving big, bold flavours? This gourmet burger bar answers the call. The Flying Start (sticky BBQ Sriracha chicken wings; R65) is a great way to kick off, and we loved the Republik Bunny Burger (lamb patty topped with Durban style potato curry; R90). Finish on an indulgent note with deep-fried Bar One bites (R50).
