According to a new study, women with tattoos share one similar trait – higher self-esteem. Researchers for The Social Science Journal surveyed 2,395 college students from six universities and were asked how many tattoos they had, and how they would rate their depression and self-esteem levels.

They were also asked whether they had ever thought about or attempted suicide.

Results showed that, for women, self-esteem went up as the number of tattoos went up. Interestingly, their findings also revealed that women with a lot of ink (four or more) were more likely to have attempted suicide at one point in their life.

The author of the study revealed to Refinery 29 that it’s possible women use body art to heal emotional wounds: “Just as breast cancer survivors and abuse victims acquire tattoos and piercings to restore physical losses,” the authors write, “we think the women in our study may be trying to restore emotional losses with more tattoos.”
