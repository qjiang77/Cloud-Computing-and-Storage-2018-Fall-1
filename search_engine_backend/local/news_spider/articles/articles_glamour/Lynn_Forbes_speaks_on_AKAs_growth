In the brief interview, which took place at the launch of AKA’s new app, Lynn gushed about how proud she is of her son. “I’ve watched Kiernan grow from [being in the rap group] Entity through the ranks…and now we’re here,” explained Forbes. “He’s been around for ten years, and it’s been amazing watching him.”

On what it takes to raise a Super Mega star, Lynn said: “It’s always been important for Tony (AKA’s dad) and I to let our kids choose their path, and not prescribe [their path] to them.”
