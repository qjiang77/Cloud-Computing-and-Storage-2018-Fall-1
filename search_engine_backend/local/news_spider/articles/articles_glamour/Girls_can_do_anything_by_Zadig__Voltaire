Girls can do anything by Zadig & Voltaire|http://www.glamour.co.za|https://www.glamour.co.za/2018/10/girls-can-do-anything-zadig-and-voltaire/|fragrance,#GLAMbeauty|2018-10-02|October||Inspired by Zadig & Voltaire’s Autumn/Winter 2017 runway show in New York, this new fragrance is an offbeat, daring, musky, and ultra-feminine scent, that will make you feel empowered and independent.

Taking cues from the Girls Can Do Anything perfume, we’ve put together a list of ten things you can do to become a girl who has a #CanDoAnything attitude.

Embody a radiant, uninhibited and impertinent new style of feminism. Break free from conventional opinions in the blink of an eye. Become emancipated with a click of your heels. Be the master of your own choices, attitudes and actions. Seize control with a disarming smile, And conquer male territory, with confidence and nonchalance. Carelessly throw convention to the wind. Be yourself wholeheartedly, freeing your body and mind. Overthrow the established order, and surprise with jubilation. Dare the unexpected, with elation.

Zadig and Voltaire’s Girls Can Do Anything scent, is on sale at selected retailers from R835 to R1615.
