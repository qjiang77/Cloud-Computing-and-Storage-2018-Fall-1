Since then, you GLAMOUR girls have been voting for your favourites non-stop, which doesn’t surprise us, as the top 10 really do have the most mesmerising smiles. We’ve counted your votes and the day for us to announce the winner of this sensational competition has at long last arrived.

We’re so happy to say that Liezel has scored the grand prize to the value of R10 000! It includes Listerine Advanced White products, a shopping spree and a spa treatment for her and a friend. What’s more, she’ll star in a photo shoot that’ll be published in GLAMOUR magazine, and strut her stuff in two videos that’ll be posted on GLAMOUR.co.za!

Here, Liezel explains why her smile makes her feel confident:

We also caught up with her to find out more about that charming smile she rocks on the daily.

GLAMOUR: What do you love most about your smile?

Liezel: It’s the one part of me that can change someone’s mood instantly.

GLAMOUR: Which three things always make you smile?

Liezel: Good food, seeing my loved ones happy and my own dry sense of humour (lol).

GLAMOUR: How do you bring smiles to the faces of others?

Liezel: (I do so) by always being optimistic, having a witty comeback/comment when interacting with others, and making people realise how amazing they are because not everyone knows their value.

Watch this space, as we’ll be featuring Liezel’s videos!
