Queen Cardi B had the most over-the-top vodka-themed birthday party|http://www.glamour.co.za|https://www.glamour.co.za/2018/10/cardi-b-surprise-birthday-party/|Pictures,Birtday party,Cardi B,vodka|2018-10-15|October||To be honest, it really shouldn’t surprise us that rap royal Cardi B did the most on her 26th birthday, but wow, Cardi B made sure to turn the dial up to “extra” on her 26th birthday—and it’s all thanks to her husband Offset.

According to People, Offset surprised Cardi by telling her they were going out for a romantic dinner—and then led her straight into a luxurious, lavish, vodka-themed surprise blowout with a ton of her friends.

And yep, it was all about Cardi: The party was sponsored by CÎROC Black Raspberry (hence the vodka theme) and included a 12-foot LED wall that projected different images of the birthday girl throughout the entire night.

There also was a dress code for the guests, so they could properly honour their rightful queen: They were instructed to wear black so that Cardi B would truly be the star of the night, which, of course, she was—especially in an electric-pink Moschino dress.

Cardi was touched and naturally responded to the whole thing with her usual strain of hilariousness: “Hubbs told me that he was gonna take me out to dinner and I appreciate the surprise birthday party and all that but I’m fucking hungry right now,” she said in one her Instagram stories. “I’m hungry but I’m so happy.”

She also posted the moment that she walked into the party and got the epic surprise from her guests on Instagram, writing, “The fact that i avoided eating dinner last night cause babe said we was going to a romantic dinner then BOOM!! 😩😩😩Thank you everybody that showed up to my surprise bday party !It was Soo beautiful Thank you babe for the surprise and everybody who was involved!”

There was a birthday serenade, too:

And to top things off, it seems Offset later presented Cardi with a dozen red roses and, according to her IG, some serious bling. He iced her out with a gigantic diamond necklace and bracelet, both of which were adorned with an equally gigantic charm that spells out “Kulture,” the name of their daughter.
