Rocking the Daisies 2018 recap|http://www.glamour.co.za|https://www.glamour.co.za/2018/10/rocking-the-daisies-2018-review/|music,rocking the daises|2018-10-08|October||If you spent any time on Instagram this weekend, you would have probably seen hundreds of FOMO-worthy snaps taken at this yearâ€™s Rocking the Daisies.

With three stages, featuring House, Hip Hop, and Rock artists, this yearâ€™s Daisies experience was LIT, to say the least!

So hereâ€™s what you missedâ€¦

The VIP VISA Deck

At #RTD2018, VISA came through with the best seat in the house! The VIP VISA deck overlooked the Lost City stage, where headliner 6Lack performed to a crowd of adoring fans. VISA also shut it down when they made it possible for Rocking the Daisies goers to have a completely cashless experience with plastic-only pay points at all food and drinks vendors.

The Festival Fashion

Step aside Coachella babes, RTD gals have got the style game on lock! Daisies divas served looks in the finest festival fashions.

The Soulection Stage

The biggest Soulection line-up in the world made its way to Rocking the Daisies this year, and it did not disappoint. Acts like Majid Jordan, Joe Kay, Shane Eagle, and, our favourite #MCM, YoungstaCPT hit the Soulection stage spitting bars and rhyming flows that had the crowd going crazy.

The Meister Haus

With a brass band playing renditions of our favourite songs, to silent disco sessions we couldnâ€™t get enough of, JÃ¤germeisterâ€™s Meister Haus was the fun-filled house party (within a festival) you needed to be at!

6Lackâ€™s performance on the main stage

The most anticipated performance at Daisies went down when the clock struck thirty minutes after midnight. US rapper 6Lack wowed die-hard fans, and new devotees as he performed hit tracks like East Atlanta Love Letter.
