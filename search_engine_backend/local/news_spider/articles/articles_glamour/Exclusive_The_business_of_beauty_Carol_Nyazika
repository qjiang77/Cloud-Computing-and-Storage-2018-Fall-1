Ndanaka. On the African continent, the emergence of beauty entrepreneurs is on the rise, so we decided to reach out to Zimbabwean businesswoman, Carol Nyazika of beauty brand

GLAMOUR: You have quite an impressive resume and have done and quite a couple things. In all these things you do, the business as well as women empowerment, what is your ultimate goal or vision?

CAROL NYAZIKA: Iâ€™ve always wanted to leave a legacy. A legacy that is rooted in the empowerment of African women. The vision behind all my entrepreneurial ventures has been to share the stories of African women and not have the West dictate what beauty and success means to us. Through Ndanaka, I want to create beauty products that make Africans feel authentically confident in who they are. I also want my children to be proud of my hard work and understand the value of the legacy that I will leave for them. I want them to have a strong starting point in life and have more options than I did when I was growing up.
