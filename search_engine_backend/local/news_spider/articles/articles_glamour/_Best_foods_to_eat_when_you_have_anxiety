From shortness of breath to heart palpitations and sweaty palms, having a panic attack is the absolute WORST!

In an attempt to outsmart your anxiety, we’ve created a list of five ‘happy’ foods to eat to prevent you from spiralling into a state of panic.

Saffron

Bet you had no idea that saffron – the stuff that you put in curry – is a mood-balancing miracle worker. Unfortunately, raw saffron is really expensive and rare. Luckily, you can take saffron extract in capsule form called Felix (available at Dischem).

Magnesium

Found in tofu, kale, and spinach, magnesium has the ability to ease angst and panic. Try making a kale smoothie, or head to your nearest pharmacy and ask them for Zinplex’s Magnesium syrup.

Valerian Root

Available in tablet and liquid form, valerian root is a natural go-to for many who suffer from anxiety. If you’re in the midst of a panic attack, place a few drops of valerian root tincture under your tongue so that it goes directly into your bloodstream.

Chocolate / Cacoa

There’s a reason why so many of us turn to chocolate when we’re having a bad day – chocolate is a natural mood booster. For an instant anxiety relief, try dropping a few pieces of dark chocolate into hot milk and stir.

Vitamin D3

Vitamin D can not only be obtained from sitting in the sun, but you can also take a vitamin d3 supplement. The tablet has the same effect as if you were soaking up the sun on the beach in St Tropez.
