Easy Freak and Robin Thirdfloor team up with H&M!|http://www.glamour.co.za|https://www.glamour.co.za/2018/10/easy-freak-robin-thirdfloor-hm/|Robin Thirdfloor,collaboration,H&M,Easy Freak,music,fashion,Local|2018-10-19|October||The music industry and fashion go hand in hand, but in recent years it seems the era of collaboration has reigned supreme. In a full-to-bursting market, it’s not only what it takes to stand out, but also what fashion needs to stay relevant in an increasingly unstable world. These collabs come in numerous forms, whether matching designers with other designers, social influencers, or in this case musicians. There are many reasons why collabs come about too, whether it being a way to push your brand beyond your own imagination or change its stereotype, to reaching a wider target audience.

And this is exactly what one of the most popular fashion houses in South Africa have done.

The brand has teamed up with R&B pop duo Easy Freak and hip-hop artist Robin Third Floor on their new summer collection! The artists can be seen looking like snacks in H&M’s new collection of floral shirts, cool shorts and fresh tee’s.

The brand announced the news yesterday with a very cool ad showing the day in the life of a musician.
