How you can change the world with red lipstick|http://www.glamour.co.za|https://www.glamour.co.za/2018/03/how-change-world-red-lipstick/|Elizabeth Arden,#GLAMxElizabethArden,Red lipstick|2018-03-20|March||Women in Hollywood are leading the charge! With A-listers like Reese Witherspoon and Shonda Rhimes standing up to injustices against women in the Time’s Up and #metoo campaigns, women around the world are following suit. As an ambassador for Elizabeth Arden, Reese is the perfect role model for a brand which was founded by a strong woman. Elizabeth Arden herself was a feminist and an advocate of women’s rights. She’s the woman who made it acceptable to wear red lipstick – a colour controversial in 1912 – and gave it to suffragettes marching on New York’s 5th Avenue.



This is exactly why Elizabeth Arden has introduced the March On campaign partnering with Reese to celebrate women’s achievements, encourage women to support each other and donate funds to the UN Women in support of their work in advancing women’s issues worldwide. And you can get in on it too – it’s as simple as buying and wearing the ultimate red lipstick. For the month of March you can buy Elizabeth Arden’s signature Red Door Red shade in a limited edition design whereby all the proceeds will go to the UN Women programme.



Simply visit an Elizabeth Arden counter anytime this month and buy yourself – and the women in your life – a March On lipstick for just R295! Shop it online now and add your voice (and perfect pout) to the powerful cause. Shop it online now.
