Jessica Nkosi serves us a fashion mom look!|http://www.glamour.co.za|https://www.glamour.co.za/2018/10/jessica-nkosi-motherhood-picture/|Picture,motherhood,girl,jessica nkosi,baby|2018-10-19|October||It’s only been a few weeks since Jessica Nkosi gave birth to her beautiful baby girl “Nami” and motherhood sure looks good on her!

She recently posted a picture of her taking her little one out for a stroll and she is looking amazing! She is also so excited about being a mom captioning the picture: “Going out for a bit with my daughter (the way I smile every time I say “my daughter” I still can’t believe she’s all MINE)”

We’re so happy to see her so happy!

See the post here:

Keep it up girl!
