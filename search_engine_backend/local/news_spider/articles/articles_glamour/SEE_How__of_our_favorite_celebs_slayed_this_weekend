We are definitely trying out some of these looks soon.

Lerato Kganyago

LKG looks like a whole meal in this look. Those boots and leather pants are to literally die for.

Ayanda Thabethe

Spring has sprung and so has Ayanda Thabethe. This floral pantsuit looks like it was made for her body. Did we mention how obsessed we are with her new hairdo? We stan.

Sthandiwe Kgoroge

Sthandiwe’s army suit is so on trend, and her silver hairdo is everything. We are definitely trying out this look. Perhaps for the office on a Thursday?

DJ Zinhle

Zinhle’s look gives us 80’s star vibe and we love it. The hair, the bandana, the sneakers, and t-shirt all go well together. She looks like a whole snack.

Boity

With a body like Boity’s, it’s hard to not slay a look, and she owned this one. Can we just take a moment and recognize Boity for her body inspiration. We are inspired to hit the gym and be summer ready.

Anele Mdoda

Hair on fleek, top on fleek, perfect skirt and facebeat popping, Anele knows how to own a look.
