World Champagne Day - The best bubbly|http://www.glamour.co.za|https://www.glamour.co.za/2018/10/world-champagne-day-best-bubbly/||2018-10-19|October||FYI, today is World Champagne Day (19.10.18). Like we needed a reason to crack open a bottle of bubbles on a Friday. LOL.

We’ve sampled quite a few bottles of bubbly over the years, and have found that these top three champagnes truly hit the spot.

Veuve Clicquot

Veuve Clicquot is like an ex boyfriend that you just can’t get rid of! No matter how many delicious, new champagnes we discover, for some reason we keep coming back to good ol’ VC for more.

Moët & Chandon

Whether you’re at the club or keeping it classy at a sit down dinner with all your girls, sipping on a flute of Moët & Chandon is a must!

Move over Cristal and Ace of Spades, Hip Hop‘s got a new favourite champagne! Made popular by ambassadors like Yemi Alade and DJ Khaled, Belaire is an easy to drink champagne that instantly elevate you to baller status.
