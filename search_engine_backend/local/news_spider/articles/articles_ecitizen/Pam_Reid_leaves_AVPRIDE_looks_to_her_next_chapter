Pam Reid leaves AVPRIDE, looks to her next chapter|http://thecitizen.com|https://thecitizen.com/2018/10/11/pam-reid-leaves-avpride-looks-to-her-next-chapter/#respond||2018-10-11|Stranger Than Fiction||The Fayette County nonprofit AVPRIDE announced Sept. 24 that long-time Executive Director Pam Reid will be leaving the organization.

“We cannot sufficiently express our gratitude for the outstanding service and leadership she has given AVPRIDE over the past eight years,” said board Chair Emily Poole. “While we fully support this next phase of her career, she will be sorely missed by all those who come in contact with our organization. She has made an indelible impact on AVPRIDE and our community, and we wish her the best in her upcoming endeavors.”

Poole said the organization during Reid’s tenure accomplished significant growth in staffing, fundraising and programming.

“With fondness and reverence, I recall the day I was introduced to AVPRIDE, some eight years ago. The world of nonprofit has shown me what it looks like and feels like to serve side-by-side with some of the hardest-working, most dedicated people I’ve ever met,” Reid said in a letter to the community.

“Today, AVPRIDE celebrates 22 years of doing an amazing work in Fayette County. Today, I celebrate my time of service and successes with this amazing organization, as well as the new endeavors I will embark upon. I am stepping down. No. I’m not relocating. Fayette County is home. It’s just time to re-pot, blossom elsewhere, and continue to operate within my gifts. I plan to do so with the same energy, passion and work ethic, in which I served AVPRIDE,” Reid said.

Reid’s last day with the organization will be on Oct. 19.
