Discussions will address many topics relevant to women, including heart health, cancer, aging, career, entrepreneurship, work-life balance, weight loss and fitness, parenting, mentoring, leadership, giving back, writing, car buying, empty nesting, goals… and more.

The American Business Women’s Association will be there, too, with a Gift Basket raffle raising funds for scholarships.

“We’re so excited about this event,” Joyce Beverly, publisher of Fayette Woman, says. “We like to think of Fayette Woman LIVE as a place where the magazine comes to life. The stories walk around and talk to you. They may even give you a hug.”

“Honestly, it’s hard for us to believe we’ve done this 200 times,” Beverly says, “We’re looking forward to celebrating this milestone with our team and all of the people who help make this possible.”

Piedmont Fayette Hospital is sponsoring the 200th Issue Celebration. Presenting sponsors are Cronic Automotive, Panasonic Automotive, and Heartis Fayetteville.
