Fayette rezones 49 acres near Tyrone to build 36 homes|http://thecitizen.com|https://thecitizen.com/2018/10/08/fayette-rezones-49-acres-near-tyrone-to-build-36-homes/||2018-10-08|Stranger Than Fiction||A proposal to rezone 48.9 acres on Dogwood Trail near Tyrone for a 36-lot subdivision was approved by the Fayette County Commission at the Sept. 27 meeting.

The rezoning request was approved on a 5-0 vote.

The property is located on the south side of Dogwood Trail, a short distance from Tyrone to the west and adjacent to Kedron Hills subdivision in Peachtree City to the south.

Agent Trent Foster requested R-50 residential zoning that would accommodate 36 single-family lots on the 48.9-acre tract.

Though properties in the unincorporated areas immediately to the east and west, along with some to the north, are zoned agricultural-residential, Foster noted that the county’s land use map calls for 1-acre lots.

Foster said price point for the homes would be in the mid- to high $300,000 range.

Commissioner Chuck Oddo during a brief discussion on the appropriateness of the rezoning said, “I always find myself in a difficult position when somebody comes to us with what we said we wanted, then we hem and haw and we’re not sure.”
