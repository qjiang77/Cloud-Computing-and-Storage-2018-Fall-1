Highway 74 North has been charged with multiple counts of overcharging the amount on gratuities on customersâ€™ bills.

Tammy Neri, 40, was charged with multiple counts of financial transaction account fraud, according to Peachtree City Police Department records.

Department spokesperson Odilia Bergh said officers on Sept. 18 responded to the restaurant in reference to fraudulent activity. A conversation with the manager led to the determination that the fraudulent activity occurred between Aug. 31 and Sept. 17, police reports said.

A felony warrant was obtained after identifying and interviewing multiple victims, according to police reports.

Bergh said Neri had adjusted the gratuity tip amount on receipts, confirming that nine people had been overcharged, with others pending.
