Models Walk on Water at Saint Laurent|http://www.elle.com/runway|http://www.elle.com/runway/g23461571/saint-laurent-spring-summer-2019-review/||2018-09-26|Nikki||At first things seemed de rigueur at Saint Laurent. As always, the show was in the Trocadéro, just a stone&#39;s throw from the Eiffel Tower. This year, though, the scene was different: White palm trees lined the water-filled runway, an unexpected move for the brand. Would the models actually walk on water? TL;DR: yes—and in heels so high I held my breath, terrified somebody would take a tragic tumble. But no one did, so as the saying goes, the show went on!

Divided into two halves, the first presentation was decidedly rocker through the ages. The ‘60s, ‘70s, and ‘80s were all represented in the leather short-shorts, long-sleeve mini dresses, knee-high croc boots, gold ankle boots, headbands, floppy hats, and glitter and band blazers.

From there, the showroom a dark turn—literally. Models in all-black looks took the catwalk. There were some chiffon gowns, bodysuits with soaring leg cuts. A few leopard looks followed: again, sheer, suggestive, and simply sexy, but then it was back to black to round out the collection.
