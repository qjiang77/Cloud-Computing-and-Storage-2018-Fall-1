Meghan and Harry are in town for the Invictus Games and will start their official engagements Tuesday. They will visit the Admiralty House, the official Sydney residence of the Governor-General of Australia, Peter Cosgrove and Lady Cosgrove, to meet representatives from each of the 18 countries participating in the Invictus Games.

After, the two will go to Taronga Zoo and the Sydney Opera House to watch a rehearsal of Spirit 2018 by the Bangarra Dance Theatre. Their day will end with a reception back at Admiralty House. Time to get adjusted to a new time zone!
