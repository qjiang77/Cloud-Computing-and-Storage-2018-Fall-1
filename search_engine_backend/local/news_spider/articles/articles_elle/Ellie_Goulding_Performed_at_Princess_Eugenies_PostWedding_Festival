Day 2 of festivities continued with a carnival themed day-party filled with food, rides, and a special performance from a British pop star.

Ellie Goulding, who was one of many the celebrity wedding guests, sang her hits live. Despite the social media ban enforced by the royals, some guests were able to sneak photos from the event.

British singer Robbie Williams also performed (but earlier, during the reception) and was photographed enjoying the fair alongside his wife Ayda Field.

Per Instyle, guests like hotel heiress Irene Forte and Baroness Cleopatra von Adelsheim von Ernest were snapped riding the carousel and winning prizes. They also enjoyed food from food stalls, a ferris wheel, and a bouncy slide while frolicking around Windsor Great Park.
