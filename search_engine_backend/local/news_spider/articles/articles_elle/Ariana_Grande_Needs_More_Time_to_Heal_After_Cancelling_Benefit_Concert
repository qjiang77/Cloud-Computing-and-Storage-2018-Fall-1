The pop star was scheduled to perform at the F— Cancer Barbara Berlanti Heroes Gala last night in Los Angeles but cancelled her appearance for personal reasons. This would have marked Grande's return to stage after the passing of ex-boyfriend Mac Miller.

According to E!, Yael Cohen Braun received an honor as co-founder of F— Cancer. Her husband and Ariana's manager, Scooter Braun, addressed the crowd and explained that Grande wasn't ready to return.

"Someone I'm very close to was supposed to come sing for you today, and because of things that she's going through, she couldn't be here today," he said. "And while I was frustrated, being the manager, my wife, being who she always is, just looked at me and she goes, 'She needs this time.'" Trevor Noah of the Daily Show performed a stand-up comedy act in Grande's place.

Ariana announced she was taking a break in early September. The singer skipped the Emmys and American Music Awards and has spent time surrounded by family and loved ones instead, according to People. This past week, she released the music video for her new single 'breathin,' starring the pet pig she adopted with fiancé Pete Davidson.
