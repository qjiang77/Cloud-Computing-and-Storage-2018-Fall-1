Paul Andrew's Sophomore Spectacular at Salvatore Ferragamo|http://www.elle.com/runway|http://www.elle.com/runway/g23377200/salvatore-ferragamo-spring-summer-2019-review/||2018-09-23|Hannah Morrill||Paul Andrew&#39;s debut fall 2018 collection as the creative director of Salvatore Ferragamo was a self-described celebration of splendor and mundanity—he told ELLE he&#39;d binge-watched The Crown and found himself particularly taken with a scene in which Princess Margaret feeds the chickens in an evening gown and muck boots. His second collection? Well, more of the (exceptionally restrained, decadently outfitted) same. Spring feels slinkier and somewhat flashier—standout pieces include an ultraviolet slip-dress, a pink sateen suit, and a few riffs on a fruity, tropical print. We also saw the addition of fishnet crochet overlays, a hand-spun counterpoint to precise Italian tailoring. It&#39;s far from a sophomore slump. Instead, a confident step forward, from old world Italy to the excitingly uncharted future of Ferragamo.
