Tap into your wild side with an animalistic shoe trend. Designers like Tom Ford and Diane von Furstenberg take on classic animal prints, but turn up bold factor with acid green cheetah spots, ruby red zebra stripes, and more. Our rule for wearing? Go all in, but avoid mixing prints. A base like all-over leopard ties the whole look together.

Fall&#39;s most wanted shoe is the cowboy boot, but with this season’s crop of chic styles there’s no need to reach for Daisy Dukes or ten-gallon hats. Fendi and Isabel Marant didn&#39;t saddle up to western stereotypes when styling the boot, so neither do you. Opt for a pair in a neutral color and team them with workwear basics: think sleek knits or a pair of flared slacks that will show just the tip of your steel toes. It’s all about hinting at the look, not cosplaying Annie Oakley.

Thanks to designers like A.P.C. and Etro, knee-high boots are back and officially our new obsession. Though they&#39;re inspired by the &#39;70s, don’t feel like you have to go full on boho. Choose a style that suits you: A pair of rich, tanned leather boots with a stacked heel for subtle types or a patchwork Dior option for the more bold. Whatever you pick, modernize the look with dark indigo sets and bohemian luxe accessories.

Give your evening heels some vitamin D by incorporating them into your daily (get it?) work attire. Contrast embellished mules with your favorite suit for a slightly frivolous but business-appropriate outfit. Bonus: They’ll be a way more interesting discussion topic at the water cooler than the weather.

A classic stiletto may be the natural pick for Girl&#39;s Night Out, but next time you plan to bar hop try an unexpected pair of surprisingly comfortable platform boots with your LBD. They&#39;re part &#39;90s supermodel, part The Matrix, and so much more comfortable than regular heels. In these, you&#39;ll actually make it to the next dive without succumbing to a barefooted walk of shame.

Hiking boots are spiking this season, but don’t plan on wearing them while soul searching on the PCT a la Reese Witherspoon. Get off the trail wear and them for your day to day, instead. These rugged boots look great against a ditsy floral backdrop, so style them with a feminine prairie dress and opt for a leisurely walk in Chloé like a modern-day Jane Austen heroine. Top your look with a surprisingly stylish jacket from Patagonia, a brand camp-enthusiasts actually back.

To say dad shoes are trending is the understatement of the year. And if you haven&#39;t given in yet, the time is now. All the major designers like Balenciaga, Acne Studios, and Louis Vuitton released versions of this chunky sneaker, but Gucci took it the the next level in sparkles. Lean into the sporty vibe and wear them with actual gym clothes and sweat-inspired statement pieces like a glittery puffer jacket.
