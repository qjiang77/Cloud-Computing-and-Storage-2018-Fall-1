Robyn Is Ready For Her Comeback|http://www.elle.com/in-the-mag|http://www.elle.com/culture/music/a23872504/robyn-is-ready-body-talk-honey-november-2018/||2018-10-17|Tasbeeh Herwees||It’s been eight years since Swedish pop star Robyn released her acclaimed Body Talk trilogy. Here’s what she’s done since then: learned how to dance the samba; took courses in production; launched Tekla, a tech festival for teenage girls in Stockholm; and recorded a mini album, Love Is Free, with keyboardist Markus Jägerstedt and legendary Swedish producer Christian Falk.

And then, in 2014, a year prior to Love Is Free’s release, Falk died from pancreatic cancer. Robyn took sometime to grieve the loss of her friend. She went through a rough breakup and re-evaluated some things in her life. She also tried therapy for the first time. All these experiences—every up, every down—comprise the sonic and lyrical DNA of her new album, Honey, out October 26. “I felt like I had a lot of respect for that process,” says the 39-year-old musician. “I think some of the things I wanted to write about kind of had to mature while I was maturing myself.”

In August, Robyn released her first single from the new project. Many took the title, “Missing U,” to be a nod to her long absence, a gift to patient fans. But the song is a deeply personal account of her attempts to find pleasure in being alive again. “I’ve turned all my sorrow into glass / It don’t leave no shadow,” she sings on the track.“When I started writing, it was about a breakup. But then it became about my friend dying,” she says. “It’s about what happens when you lose somebody. I felt really in touch with my feelings and my life.”

Upon the release of Body Talk (Pt. 1, Pt. 2, and Pt. 3), Robyn established herself as an electronic pop artist whose emotions-first lyrics brought vulnerability to the nightclub dance floor. These were her fifth, sixth, and seventh studio albums, all released in the same year under her own label, Konichiwa Records, which she founded after parting with Jive Records. The trilogy was adored by fans and critics. “Dancing On My Own,” the opening track of Pt. 1, reached number one in Sweden and number 13 on the Billboard 100 chart for rising singles. But Robyn’s appeal has never been conventional—some of her songs, like Pt. 1’s “Don’t Fucking Tell Me What to Do,” depict a brash, confrontational artist who’s determined to protect her autonomy.

And Honey promises to deliver, in many ways, classic Robyn: glittering, diaristic electronic pop anthems undergirded by throbbing beats that induce your hips to sway. It took almost half a decade of therapy to contend with the feelings fleshed out on the album, but the process brought her back to a place where she could make music again, “a softer place where I felt more vulnerable and more excited about music than I’ve been in a very long time,” she says. “I had a big crisis, and that’s when the therapy started really working, because I think I just didn’t have any filters.”

She spent about a year working on Honey on her own, and then invited friends like English producer Joseph Mount to contribute.“Missing U” opens with his bright, shimmering synths, “like the sun hitting a water surface,” she says. The title track, with its glossy production and pulsating club rhythms, debuted in the final season of Girls. “Ever Again,” another track that narrates a re-emergence from grief, has a disco-inspired tempo. She tried to find rhythms that made her feel good, rhythms that were healing, she says. That desire was also behind her decision to take up samba dancing—and why the album is bursting with highly danceable riffs. “It gives people pleasure to feel a rhythm and then move their body to it,” she says.“It’s a knowledge that’s really old. It’s probably way, way older than electronic music.”
