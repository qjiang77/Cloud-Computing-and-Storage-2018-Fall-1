According to People, the quickie ceremony was all Hailey&#39;s idea. &quot;Hailey is a very bright girl. She’s not just blindly adoring Justin and doing whatever he wants,” says the source. &quot;She’s wanted to be with Justin for a very long time.&quot;

The couple plans to have a big ceremony with friends and family eventually, but Hailey felt that &quot;officially becoming husband and wife sooner rather than later solidified them as a team.&quot; Baldwin also thought it was the best way to prove any doubters or critics wrong. &quot;The city hall marriage was her idea. It was &#39;you and me against the world,&#39;&quot; says the source. &quot;Let&#39;s show [everyone] we&#39;re serious and it’s not just some crazy fling.&quot;

To make things even more official, Hailey recently filed court documents to trademark &quot;Hailey Bieber&quot; for clothing line and business purposes, as first reported by The Blast.
