According to Express, Meghan and Harry want their child to lead a &#39;relatively normal life&#39; and will not seek an official royal title for their baby. A source told The Sunday Times, &quot;That word ‘normal’ looms very large for Harry and Meghan when it comes to their child’s future.&quot;

A big part of this normal lifestyle starts without a title, although there are options. Meghan and Harry&#39;s child is seventh-in-line for the throne and if a boy, can receive the title of Earl of Dumbarton, a title given to Harry by Queen Elizabeth on his wedding day. If a girl, the title Lady Mountbatten-Windsor would be given, and any sons after would be named Lord Mounbatten-Windsor.

The Sussexes are opting to protect their child from intense media attention, following in the footsteps of Harry&#39;s aunt Princess Anne. &quot;Princess Anne, the Queen&#39;s only daughter, turned down royal titles for her two children who have lived relatively independent lives and have gone on to have their own careers,&quot; reports Express and notes that Meghan and Harry&#39;s no title choice, &quot;coincides with Prince Charles&#39; vision for a slimmed-down monarchy in the future focused on the direct line to the throne of himself, William and his children.&quot;

The choice also makes sense given Harry&#39;s complicated feelings towards being a royal. Harry has been outspoken about the &quot;tricky balancing act&quot; he experienced growing up and has gone on record saying, &quot;I didn&#39;t want to be in the position I was in.&quot;
