According to the Sunday Times via Mail Online, Meghan's longtime BFF and stylist Jessica Mulroney will be joining the Sussexes on their trip, along with her own husband, Ben. The couple are joining Meghan and Harry "in an 'unofficial' capacity - meaning they will pay their own expenses." So basically, Jessica and Ben are just going for fun. Couples trip, anyone?

The 16 day tour kicks off at the Sydney Opera House on Tuesday and other stops include Fiji, Tonga and New Zealand. Meghan will reportedly have up to three outfit changes a day, which Mulroney will probably have a hand in. Jessica is believed to have styled Markle's engagement outfit back in November and her recent visit to the Nelson Mandela Centenary Exhibit at London's South Bank, where she wore a trench coat by Canadian brand House of Nonie.
