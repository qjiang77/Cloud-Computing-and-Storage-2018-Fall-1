Who Would Wear Dries Van Noten Spring 2019? Absolutely Everyone|http://www.elle.com/runway|http://www.elle.com/runway/g23475347/dries-van-noten-spring-summer-2019-review/||2018-09-27|Nikki||In a fashion month that’s been heavy on the experiences—and performances! and events!—and light on actual clothes, Dries Van Noten took showgoers back to basics, presenting a bright, cheery, and most important wearable, women’s collection.

This is not to say what others have been doing is wrong—instead it highlights that while the events surrounding this show were normal (two rows of seats in Paris’ Palais de Tokyo, no water filled runway, no ballet troupe), the clothes were so eye-catching, color combinations so arresting, beauty looks so, well, beautiful…that it didn’t matter that we were just sitting in a room with a white carpet watching models parade by.

As the metronome-like ticking of the show music kicked off, a model walked out wearing a white trench coat, slouchy trousers, and a yellow feathery top. Dries was off to great start. From there, more formal looks injected with colors like jade, cobalt, pink, and lime traipsed by. Florals were paired with diagonal stripes. It&#39;s how we all want to dress, but only gallerinas seem able to pull off.



But there were pieces for the more low-key pal in your friend group as well: cap sleeve button down blouses paired with cargo (!!) pants and pencil skirts. A tailored navy suit perfect for those of us who still need to wear suits to work, plus a khaki one for when navy is too dour. With this collection Dries Van Noten gave his woman clothing she&#39;d love to wear—and feel comfortable in while doing so. Even the more adorned pieces, done up with feather and glitter embellishments, seemed to work. This season, I&#39;ve found myself asking, &quot;Yes, but who would wear that?&quot; At Dries today the answer was clear: everyone.
