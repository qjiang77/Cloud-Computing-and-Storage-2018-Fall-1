According to Page Six, the comedian isn&#39;t ruling out a reunion. &quot;I talked to Pete a few days ago and he was joking again,” said a source. “He’s still in love with Ariana and sees a future with her.” But in the meantime, “He knows [the breakup] is for the best.&quot;

Grande and Davidson&#39;s split follows a whirlwind engagement that was tested following the death of rapper and Ariana&#39;s ex Mac Miller in September. &quot;Ariana has been devastated and Pete couldn’t handle it,&quot; another source told The Sun. &quot;She realized she needs a grown-up who can support her and that’s not him.&quot;

Another difficulty was the drastic lifestyle change that comes with being engaged to a pop star. &quot;[Pete&#39;s] a private dude who feels more at home being on stage doing comedy in small clubs and being around close friends and family,&quot; the source adds. &quot;He would always joke about how he was out of her league — and yeah, he really believed [it].&quot;

Despite the hardships, the source insists, &quot;They were really in love.&quot;
