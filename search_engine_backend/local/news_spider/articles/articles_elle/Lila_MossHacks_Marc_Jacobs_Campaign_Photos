I see you, Lila!



Moss-Hack, who is now signed to her mother's namesake modeling agency, took to her newly started Instagram to announce her role with the brand. She debuted an image from her first major beauty campaign with Marc Jacobs Beauty, and her violet cat eye is killer.

Mom Kate flaunted Lila's skills on Instagram too, sharing a behind the scenes video of Lila's shoot.

"BTS @marcbeauty campaign with @lilamoss ✨," Kate captioned the video, and she's not the only one gushing over Lila Moss's beauty debut. Marc Jacobs himself posted a touching Instagram tribute to the new model, reflecting on the first time he met Lila.



"When I met @lilamoss for the first time in 2008, I was on a holiday in Ibiza and went to Formentera for the day to visit with her mom, Kate Moss, and other friends and family. At just 6 years old, Lila’s strong character, demeanor and great beauty was already very apparent. The next time I saw Lila was in August of 2011 at Kate’s wedding, her character was even more dynamic and her beauty even greater.

This past July is that last time I saw Lila when Kate brought her to the set of our @marcbeauty campaign shoot with @davidsimsofficial. It was a bit surreal to have Kate in the studio with Lila as it brought back memories of the first time I met Kate when she was 18 years old and cast to walk for the Perry Ellis’ Spring/Summer 1993 Grunge Collection...Lila’s beauty, composure, patience and kindness made this project even more special than I could have imagined. With each look we photographed, she got into each character effortlessly and gracefully. Thank you, Lila, for being a part of this extremely special project and thank you, @katemossagency
