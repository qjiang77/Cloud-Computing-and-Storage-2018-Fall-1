Why Meghan Markle Is No Longer Attending Several Royal Tour Events With Prince Harry|http://www.elle.com/culture|http://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a24000067/why-meghan-markle-missing-several-royal-tour-events-with-prince-harry/||2018-10-21|Alyssa Bailey||Meghan Markle and Prince Harry have had a pretty intense week with five days full of engagements and travel during their royal tour of Australia. Today, the two were both due out to watch the cycling event at the Invictus Games, which just began yesterday. But only Harry is going to the morning event. Kensington Palace has just informed royal reporters that Meghan will miss it to get some extra rest after a late night (the Invictus Games opening ceremony started late due to weather)...and will be skipping some other events too to preserve her stamina, particularly in light of her just-announced pregnancy. This was a decision the couple made jointly.

“She’s feeling fine but resting,” a royal source told reporter Emily Nash of Meghan&#39;s condition today. A source told Daily Mail&#39;s Rebecca English similar, saying the Duchess of Sussex is fine, and they just want to &quot;pace&quot; her because the two do have a lot of events left.

One source tells me it isn’t that the duchess is feeling poorly, but they’re trying to ‘pace’ her given how many engagements are coming up. The couple are due to undertake 76 on the 16-day tour. It is unlikely Meghan will do many engagements on Fraser Island due to the terrain — Rebecca English (@RE_DailyMail) October 21, 2018

Harry himself told game competitors that Meghan is &quot;resting back at home; being pregnant takes its toll,&quot; during his morning event.

Meghan is due to still attend the afternoon reception that the Prime Minister will host for them. But she will also skip some if not all of the events for two&#39;s planned visit to Fraser Island tomorrow. The two were supposed to visit the island&#39;s rain forests, attend a Welcome to Country Smoking Ceremony with the Traditional Owners of K&#39;gari, the Butchulla People and the Premier of Queensland, visit one of the island&#39;s lakes, then ultimately travel to Kingfisher Bay by boat to walk the beach there. A lot and on particularly tricky terrain, as Fraser Island is the largest sand island in the world.

Harry will be at all the events although Meghan will travel with him to Fraser Island, so there&#39;s a possibility she may accompany him on some engagements still.

The Duchess of Sussex won’t be attending the cycling this morning after last night’s late finish, but should join the Duke for the other engagements. “She’s feeling fine, but resting,” says a royal source. #IG2018 #RoyalTourAustralia — Emily Nash (@emynash) October 21, 2018

“After a busy programme, The Duke and Duchess have decided to cut back The Duchess&#39;s schedule slightly for the next couple of days, ahead of the final week and a half of the tour,” says a royal aide #DukeandDuchessOfSussex #RoyalVisitAustralia — Emily Nash (@emynash) October 21, 2018

Meghan WILL travel to Fraser Island as planned but may not undertake engagements as planned.. — Emily Nash (@emynash) October 21, 2018

Fraser Island is the world’s largest Sand island and is difficult terrain to travel on - especially for a pregnant woman. It makes sense that the Duchess would rest up instead of doing everything on tomorrow’s itinerary. #RoyalVisitAustralia — Emily Nash (@emynash) October 21, 2018

As the royal aide told Nash though, “After a busy programme, The Duke and Duchess have decided to cut back The Duchess&#39;s schedule slightly for the next couple of days, ahead of the final week and a half of the tour. The Duke will attend the cycling as scheduled this morning, and The Duchess will join him for this afternoon&#39;s engagements. The Duke will continue with the engagements on Fraser Island as planned.”

The Palace has not announced whether any engagements beyond day 6 and 7 of the tour will be changed at this point, though the possibility remains. At this point, English reports that Meghan is still due to fly to Fiji and Tonga with Harry in the coming days, but her tour schedule may be changed there too:
