I Have Really Oily Skin. These Are the 10 Blotting Sheets I Swear By.|http://www.elle.com/beauty|http://www.elle.com/beauty/makeup-skin-care/g23872225/best-blotting-papers-for-oily-skin/||2018-10-18|Kristina Rodulfo||As someone who has struggled with controlling oil production on my face (I&#39;ve tried primers, powders, marshmallow cushions, you name it), I consider myself an expert in all methods of mattifying. And while having oily skin is not a bad thing—hello, fountain of youth—I personally am not a fan of that shiny film that pops up on my T-zone by 2PM. And, don&#39;t try to tell me it looks &quot;dewy&quot;—dewy is bouncy luminosity conveniently located on your cheekbones and brow bones. What I have is a mask of grease. In dire times, I reach for blotting sheets: little papers that offer quick touch-ups so you don&#39;t have to resort to using toilet seat covers (been there). See my favorites, ahead.
