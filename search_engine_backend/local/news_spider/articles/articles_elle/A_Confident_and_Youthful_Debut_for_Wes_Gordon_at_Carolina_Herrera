A Confident and Youthful Debut for Wes Gordon at Carolina Herrera|http://www.elle.com/fashion-week|http://www.elle.com/runway/g23063483/carolina-herrera-spring-summer-2019-review-wes-gordon/||2018-09-11|Yousra Attia,Leah Chernikoff||Monday&#39;s Carolina Herrera show marked Wes Gordon&#39;s official debut as the creative director of the brand. The label&#39;s founder sat front row, a very visible show of support for the young designer&#39;s inaugural collection at helm. Herrera&#39;s label has always been a stalwart among the ladies who lunch: elegant evening wear and prim, crisp suiting in thick shiny silks. Could Gordon, who is just 31, make it appeal to a younger consumer while still maintaining the loyalty of the label&#39;s doyennes?

It&#39;s an auspicious start. Gordon injected the collection with youthful design flourishes (bright floral appliques, looser silhouettes) and even more youthful hemlines (skirts with high hemlines and slits up to there). The collection felt fun and joyful as well as more commercial. If anything, those ladies who lunch may have less to choose from unless they&#39;re ready to show some thigh. But candy-striped and voluminous evening wear should please all ages.
