See Every Look in the Moschino x H&M Collection|http://www.elle.com/fashion|http://www.elle.com/fashion/shopping/g23720671/the-moschino-x-handm-mickey-mouse-mtv/||2018-10-11|Nerisha Penrose||Jeremy Scott has never been one for subtlety. We can always count on the designer to deliver his signature whimsical, over-the-top designs in his Moschino collectionsâ€”and his new collaboration with H&M is no different. In the past, Scott has looked to his favorite cartoon characters like SpongeBob SquarePants and Barbie as a source of inspiration. For this collection, Scott dug into his toy chest for new muses like Mickey and Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck, and Goofy who appear throughout the collection. Elsewhere, Scott salutes '90s streetwear and pop culture with gold chains, leather, logos and an assortment of MTV merchandise. See every look from the Moschino x H&M capsule collection, ahead.
