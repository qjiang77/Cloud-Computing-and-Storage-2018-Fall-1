I have a wonderful facialist, Terri Lawton. She picks upon your energy and tailors every facial. I go to see her whenever I’m in Los Angeles.I like products that make my skin feel soft and wonderful, like Retrouvé—especially the Nutrient Face Serum ($395) and Revitalizing EyeConcentrate ($415). I also use the organic skincare line ISUN.

Airplane Essential

I apply The Lost Explorer Traveler’s Protection Balm ($36) when I’m on a plane. It’s a light, natural moisturizer.You can even put it in your nose to help you breathe better, because it has camphor and eucalyptus-leaf oils.

Signature Scent

When I’m into a fragrance, I tend to wear it every day. It’s really for me more than anyone else. I fell in love with Black Opium ($91) a few years ago. It’s sweet, but not too sweet, because of the musk undertones. It’s a nice balance of masculine and feminine, and it’s not overpowering.

Hair Musts

I use Grown Alchemist Shampoo and Conditioner ($49 each), then Bumble and bumble Hairdresser’sInvisible Oil ($40). Nikki Nelms is my hairstylist—she does my hair for every event.

I drink apple cider vinegar. It doesn’t taste great, but it gives you energy.

Hole Truth

I have a decent number of piercings, so I don’t know ifI need more. J. Colby Smith has been piercing me since I was 18. My nose, my ears—six in one, five in the other—and my nipple. But I could say tomorrow that I desperately need an eyebrow piercing.

Typical Workout

I hike, run, jog, or go to the gym and do the elliptical or the treadmill. I also do simple strengthening moves like squats, sit-ups, and push-ups.

Health Trick

I drink apple cider vinegar. It doesn’t taste great, but it gives you energy, helps your immune system, and is great for the skin.

Drink Order

Suntory Hibiki, a Japanese whiskey, is my favorite. And a glass of rosé on a hot day is really magical.



Hangover Hack

Lots of water, plus coconut water and bread to soak it all up. And I love to steam. Sweating it out is the way to go.
