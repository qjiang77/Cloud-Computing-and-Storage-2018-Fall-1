Lavishness Has Levity at Tod's Spring 2019 Show|http://www.elle.com/runway|http://www.elle.com/runway/g23355947/tods-spring-2019-show/||2018-09-21|Hannah Morrill||If you are from New England, you might prefer to hide your wealth in the trunk of your beat-up Volvo, or under the weathered clapboards of your seaside cottage. If you are from Tod&#39;s Italy, you might prefer to hide flaunt your wealth in absolutely any way possible, from head to toe and back again. Fringed snakeskin moccasins (with a matching blazer)? Of course. A cinched thigh-high coat of snake and suede? Why not! Patchwork was a theme hereâ€”tuxedo pants and bomber jackets were striped with contrasting leathers, one model wore an intarsia knit sweater. But transformation was a theme, too. One top that looked like intarsia was actually stitched-together leather. A diaphanous silky skirt wasn&#39;t silk at all. Instead, a feat of leathered draping. And yet, at Tod&#39;s, opulence doesn&#39;t feel stiff or stuffy. Worn in plain sight, and reimagined in creative shapes, lavishness has levity.
