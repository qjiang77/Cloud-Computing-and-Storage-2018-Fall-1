Katy seems keen on driving the point home with praise for Swift, who recently went political for the first time.

&quot;She’s setting a great example,&quot; Perry told Variety at the amfAR Gala on Thursday. Swift sent headlines ablaze earlier this month after posting a lengthy Instagram post endorsing two Democratic congressional candidates. She also reminded fans to vote during her American Music Awards speech.

Perry, who was an outspoken supporter of Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election, was honored with a Courage Award at the event. Perry wore a light blue gown with dramatic feathers and was accompanied by boyfriend Orlando Bloom.

Taylor and Katy&#39;s history stems way back to a revealing interview with Rolling Stone four years ago, which started speculation that the song &#39;Bad Blood&#39; was about Perry.

For years, I was never sure if we were friends or not,&quot; Swift said. &quot;She would come up to me at awards shows and say something and walk away, and I would think, &#39;Are we friends, or did she just give me the harshest insult of my life?&#39; [Then] she did something so horrible. I was like, &#39;Oh, we&#39;re just straight-up enemies.&#39; And it wasn&#39;t even about a guy! It had to do with business...She basically tried to sabotage an entire arena tour. She tried to hire a bunch of people out from under me. And I&#39;m surprisingly nonconfrontational—you would not believe how much I hate conflict. So now I have to avoid her. It&#39;s awkward, and I don&#39;t like it.

Last year during an interview with James Corden, Perry admitted &quot;there&#39;s a situation [between me and Swift]. For sure, that&#39;s true. There&#39;s a situation. Honestly, it&#39;s really like she started it, and it&#39;s time for her to finish it.&quot;



But she would later go on to apologize to Swift during her Witness livestream. “I’m ready to let it go,&quot; she said during an interview with Arianna Huffington’s Thrive Global Podcast. &quot;Absolutely, 100 percent. I forgive her, and I’m sorry for anything I ever did, and I hope the same from her, and I think it’s actually—I think it’s time.”
