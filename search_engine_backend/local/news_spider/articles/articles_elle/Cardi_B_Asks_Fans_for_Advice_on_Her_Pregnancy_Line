The new mom is referring to her pregnancy line, which is common and usually caused by changing hormones or the imbalance of hormones, according to the American Pregnancy Association via People.

One fan reassured Cardi that the line would fade eventually. &quot;It will go away in time. Promise. Just keep using cocoa butter to stay hydrated and it will go away in a few months,&quot; she wrote. &quot;Happens all the time to women of all colors.&quot;

Cardi&#39;s pregnancy line question follows an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, where the rapper gave some honest insight about childbirth.
