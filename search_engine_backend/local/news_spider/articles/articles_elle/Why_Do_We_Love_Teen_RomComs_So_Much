Why Do We Love Teen Rom-Coms So Much?|http://www.elle.com|http://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/a23743855/teen-rom-coms-to-all-the-boys-ive-loved-before-kissing-booth/||2018-10-12|Arabelle Sicardi||2018 Twitter seems to have two modes: outrage about real life, and joy about escapist fictional realms. While America experiences a slow roast, of both a climatic and political nature, we are also experiencing a renaissance of romantic comedies. The world is terrible, but To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before is amazing.

When so much media seems to be about trauma and the failures of society, engaging with a world in which love isn’t just a lifeline in dark times, but the fulcrum of human experience—that is joyful! It feels worthwhile! Because if not love, then what for? Unlike prestige TV, which is often morose, interested in the worst sides of human experience, and full of unlikeable characters, rom-coms aren’t trying to teach you anything, or even do anything but talk about love and how amazing it is when you feel it for someone else.

Naysayers of romantic comedies say they’re inconsequential, or even damaging, because they’re clichéd and traditionally exclusionary. My extremely cold take is that everything doesn’t need to be revolutionary (although art will always be political)—nor does it need to teach some huge moral lesson to be worthwhile. You shouldn’t have to experience immense suffering to deserve good things, and to have good things happen to you or to be memorable; every story we tell doesn’t have to be dystopian or fantastical. Don’t forget—many of the most everlasting stories we tell as humans aren’t even tragedies—Shakespeare had plenty of comedies, and we have no problem as a culture obsessing over his oeuvre. Some of the best romantic comedies (Ten Things I Hate About You, She’s the Man, Warm Bodies) are just retellings of his work.

At the center of it all, romantic comedies rule because the best ones make you love everyone involved. Take Clueless, which made rich, ditzy white girl Cher into a sweet, matchmaking, fundraising angel, and square bookworm Josh into an aspirational hottie. These movies encourage emotional investment in the characters and reward us for that devotion. When we watch some movies, we endure with the characters, and sure, often we sympathize with what they’re going through. But watching a good rom-com is like going on a fun first date with yourself. It makes you excited and curious about this puddle of feelings inside of you.

I call this being drunk on the crush-zone, and it’s like the most wholesome drug. In real life, trying to find love often feels daunting, like a puzzle of problems you have to decide either to solve or get used to. Conversely, the crush-zone is a short-lived, gorgeous mirage. That sweet headspace is the whole journey in rom-coms. It’s a (unfortunately, often literally) straight shot of curiosity, anxiety, hope, vulnerability, tenderness, and celebration—and then the credits roll. It is the best-case scenario we fantasize about and rarely experience for ourselves.

"Watching a good rom-com is like going on a fun first date with yourself."

This focus on the exhilarating velocity and warmth of crushes is why teen rom-coms specifically are enjoying such popularity. They liberate us from regular concerns and dump us straight into that beautiful space, a fantasy featuring no real responsibility or risk. The drama is predictable, nearly algorithmic—and still completely rewarding. We can just think about love in its most hopeful, anticipatory, buzzing form: the crush.

But what makes recent, hugely popular teen rom-coms To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before and The Kissing Booth feel even more freeing is that emotional development takes center stage. Since most of these movies’ stars are relative unknowns, we’re falling in love with the stories and not the fact that a favorite star is ridiculously good looking again after "suffering" through glasses and greasy hair for a while.

There’s also not one makeover montage—that loveable but problematic rom-com staple—in sight. The makeover montage trope is much maligned, understandably, because its apparent insistence that hotness and chicness is the gateway to loveworthiness is objectionable. But I like romantic comedies and these montages because the lesson they really teach is that we love each other precisely because of our differences, and not in spite of them. Personal aesthetics are usually part of rom-coms, but not the point of good ones. Think Princess Bride, Pretty Woman, and She’s All That.

Makeovers are just rapid becomings—from farm girl to princess-in-waiting, from “ugly” teen to prom queen—and it would be a lie if I said I never changed even a little every time I fell in love. Rom-com characters usually do change for the better, and the people getting makeovers are often not the ones who need to evolve the most; it’s the people asking them to adapt who do. They project what they think it should mean to be desirable onto someone else, only to realize that those alterations don’t hide or build what must be there to begin with for anything to matter. TATBILB and The Kissing Booth bypass that tired question, and let their characters focus on emotional matters.

TALBILB is also amazing because an Asian American—Lara Jean Covey (Lana Condor)—finally gets to be the center of a story without the whole point of the story being the struggles of Asian American identity. There are aspects of her heritage sprinkled throughout the film—those famous yogurt cups being one of them. These moments aren’t used as signifiers of alienation and shame; they’re just part of the background. It turns out that we can be normal, fully formed human beings—not just sidekicks who help the story along! People of color are often expected to present trauma-first identities that help an assumed white viewer learn about our cultures. But people of color shouldn’t have to be exceptional to be worth listening to. TATBILB takes representation seriously and handles it with love. It’s sincere in a time when feeling sincere about love and vulnerability feels naïve, rare, and brave as hell.

To All the Boys I've Loved Before Netflix

Humor me, but I like the representation in the other Netflix film, The Kissing Booth, too. The leads aren’t polished and collected beings in the ways less successful rom-coms and blockbusters often require. (They are all cis white heterosexuals, but don’t worry—I’ll tolerate that, because I’m empathetic and accepting of people unlike myself.) Elle Evans (played by Joey King) has big, frizzy hair, is genuinely going through body changes she feels self-conscious about—anyone who’s gone through it knows that boob and hip growth (and the attention they get you) can be traumatizing.

But rather than having her suffer interminably from that anxiety and making her over, they have everyone else accept her for who she really is. She doesn’t shrink away: She gets snarkier. When she’s rejected, she gets loud about how much she deserves love—and how amazing her body is, regardless of other people’s judgments. (Who hasn’t wanted to yell “My boobs are fantastic” in a public place?) People celebrate her, they listen to her, and she falls in love. Who doesn’t want that?

The return of rom-coms feels like a lighthouse in the dark void that reality has become. The fact that teen movies—especially romantic ones—have become more realistic and expansive with their casting and storytelling is a balm in world that needs a lot more comfort. Blessings to predictable, joyful, indulgent experiences that we can turn to when we are exhausted and cynical and distrustful of the world, and to the (gradual) shift in representation that allows more of us to see ourselves in the stories we have always loved. And most of all, blessings upon that crush-zone, for making us feel good again, if only for a short while—all we need to do is open up Netflix.
