When Karlie noticeably left Taylor off her best friends list in a Porter interview and Taylor snubbed Karlie in her 'Look What You Made Me Do' music video, many assumed they were no longer friends. Now, the model is getting honest about their relationship.

During a recent video with Vogue's 73 Questions, the interviewer asks Karlie, “I just have to get this out of the way, because the world deserves to know: is everything cool with you and Taylor?”

“The world needs to know?” Kloss laughed. “Well, Jennifer Lawrence was interested. Jen, don’t worry, Taylor and I are still really good friends.”

This statement checks out with an Instagram post Kloss shared in August. The model attended Swift's Reputation tour stop in Nashville, where she congratulated her on a job well done.

Despite claims that the two are still close, Taylor has yet to comment on Karlie's engagement to longtime boyfriend Josh Kushner. Taylor, who recently went political for the first time and condemned a Republican candidate, has mostly kept to herself alongside boyfriend Joe Alwyn.
