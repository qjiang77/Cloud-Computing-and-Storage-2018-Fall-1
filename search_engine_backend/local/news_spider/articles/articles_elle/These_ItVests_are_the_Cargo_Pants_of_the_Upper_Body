These It-Vests are the Cargo Pants of the Upper Body|http://www.elle.com/fall-fashion|http://www.elle.com/fashion/shopping/a23725170/these-it-vests-are-the-cargo-pants-of-the-upper-body/||2018-10-11|Justine Carreon||Recently I&#39;ve developed a bad habit of picking the brains of ELLE.com&#39;s Gen Z-related staffers for insider information on the next big trends. Luckily, they&#39;re more than willing to oblige. Nerisha Penrose is ELLE.com&#39;s assistant editor and Resident Youth, and the go-to expert on Instagram It-girls, the hottest streetwear brands, and, strangely enough, Ed Sheeran. After I noticed her wearing a utility vest, the Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon kicked in and I started seeing it everywhere, particularly on our favorite Instagram models. &quot;The chest rigs are the choice accessory of hypebeasts everywhere,&quot; she declared.

&quot;The vest is perfect for those (me) who care about functionality just as much as they do aesthetics,&quot; Nerisha said. &quot;I carry about 4 different lip glosses, a pen, my phone, and other knick knacks around with me all day long, and the vest takes away the stress and pain of lugging a handbag around.&quot;

Utilitarian fashion is nothing new—even Madewell has a millennial lavender coverall—but these chest pockets represent a new wave of practical style. The fanny pack is slowly being replaced by the utility vest, which are basically the cargo pants of the upper body.

Nerisha bought her first vest off Frankie Collective (&quot;a online e-tailer that sells reworked versions of sportswear classics&quot;), but you can go straight to the source material and buy one meant for dads who birdwatch.

Ignore the middle aged stock model and imagine popping the vest over a floral dress or track pants. For your information, this particular vest has fourteen pockets. With this trending style, your life will be instantly transformed into a neatly organized torso. This vest is the sartorial manifestation of Marie Kondō. &quot;No, I don’t like fishing, hunting, or construction work, but the utility vest stacked against an oversized hoodie or t-shirt takes me from refined to rugged,&quot; Penrose said.

If you&#39;re looking for a sportier style disassociated from fly fishing, Nike has you covered. The unisex look pairs well with your favorite atheleisure outfit, but Penrose suggests a bright hoodie with jewelry and heeled booties. You don&#39;t even need a handbag, because all your needs can be placed in one of your many, many, compartments. If your life is falling apart, this vest will get it in order.
