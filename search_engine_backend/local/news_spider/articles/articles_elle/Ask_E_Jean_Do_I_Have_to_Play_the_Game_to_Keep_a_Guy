Ask E. Jean: Do I Have to Play the Game to Keep a Guy?|http://www.elle.com/life-love|http://www.elle.com/life-love/ask-e-jean/advice/a31852/ask-e-jean-playing-the-game/||2018-10-17|E. Jean||Dear E. Jean: So. Is it true I have to play the stupid game? Do I have to follow flirting protocol to make sure a guy sticks around? I ABSOLUTELY DESPISE THIS! I&#39;ve tried to duck the rules since high school, but you can&#39;t—can you? You really do have to smile at the appropriate times, make the &quot;cute&quot; mistakes, insert a joke here and a laugh there, right? Ugh! I want to go on strike! —Fed Up

Dear Fed: Did you say...strike? You charming half-wit. Don&#39;t you know that chasing guys is the greatest pleasure there is? Didn&#39;t you grok in high school that your rebel&#39;s attitude was a cunning (maybe the cunningest) move in &quot;the stupid game&quot;? Hasn&#39;t it dawned in that big head of yours that the reason you&#39;re here...that the future of the human race depends on you playing the game as the greatest rebel on planet Earth? Come on.

You want to be a zeitgeist grappler and defy the game? Good luck. Mother Nature will almost always force you to smile at the &quot;appropriate times.&quot; I say &quot;almost,&quot; because I just saw a BBC documentary in which British scientists tossed 100 single women and men into a speed-dating experiment. Several of the women did curb their instincts to smile (so as to look cool) and came off looking like the cadavers on Cold Case. However, a rather plain-looking woman, a brain type who simply followed her instincts, listened to the guys, laughed at their jokes, and cast them a quiet stream of compliments (she also happened to be wearing a very pretty dress that showed off her tiny waist), got three times—three times—the number of date requests as the other women.

My advice: Get out of your own way. Let your natural predilections loose, and just be yourself.
