Christian Dior's Spring 2019 Collection Is an Homage to the Power of Dance|http://www.elle.com/runway|http://www.elle.com/runway/g23400049/christian-dior-spring-summer-2019-collection-review/||2018-09-24|Nikki||Fashion&#39;s obsession with dance is no secret. Often a source of inspiration, the graceful movements of dancers both past and present has served as a jumping off point for many designers. Today, Maria Grazia Chiuri joins that group, kicking off Paris Fashion Week with a Dior collection that pays homage to heroines of contemporary dance like Lo√Øe Fuller, Isadora Duncan, Martha Graham, and Pina Bausch.

&quot;The experience of dance, it&#39;s most intimate truth, the fact that it is a means of universal expression, and the radicality of the gestures of contemporary dance have all stimulated my imagination,&quot; Chiuri said in the show notes. The collection reflected that: Jersey dresses in white and sand; ballet-ready body suits in black, gray, beige, and pink. Tights were layered under pleated tutu-like skirts, while spaghetti strap tank tops replaced the corsets we&#39;re used to seeing from Chiuri. It was a quite literal take on the inspiration, which seemed to work though it could have come off as very costume-y. There were even clothes for the dancer who may not have made it professionally (or transitioned to corporate life after retiring!): Bermuda short suits, Army green cargo pants, sharp navy blue blazers and matching culottes.

And what&#39;s a dance-inspired runway show without a little performance, right? As the models walked the peripheral of the dark box at the Longchamp Racecourse where the show took place, choreographer Sharon Eyal and eight dancers from her company performed a hypnotic piece by Eyal set to a thumping soundtrack. Confetti fell around the dancers, like leaves falling from trees, creating a shadowy forest-like setting for the unexpected collection.
