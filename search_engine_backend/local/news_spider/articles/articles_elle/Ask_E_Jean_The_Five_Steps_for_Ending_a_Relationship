Ask E. Jean: The Five Steps for Ending a Relationship|http://www.elle.com/life-love|http://www.elle.com/life-love/ask-e-jean/q-and-a/a39/ask-e-jean-the-five-steps-for-ending-a-relationship/||2018-09-28|E. Jean||Dear E. Jean: My boyfriend is a freeloader, a moocher, and a lazy bum who&#39;s depleting my groceries, my toiletries (my $30 shampoo!), and my patience. He clings to me 24-7. If I say, &quot;Let&#39;s take some time away from each other,&quot; he refuses. The longest he&#39;s gone without seeing me—I send him to his parents&#39; house—is one day. Then he&#39;s back in my apartment. He&#39;s a physical trainer but has no work, never pays for anything, smokes weed all day, and is on unemployment, and, on top of everything, I pick up the checks when we go out, and he borrows money from me. I&#39;m so sick of it. He&#39;s 30! I know he loves me unconditionally, but I can&#39;t support a grown man forever. Please help me break up with him kindly, without creating resentment and anger. —Feeling Guilty but About to Explode!

Girl, Please: A 30-year-old blood-sucker is wound around your torso, ramming its proboscis into any place it can find a credit card, and you feel guilty? Get rid of him! There&#39;s no way to detach a leech without causing pain, and, as you know, you must never remove a leech with salt, matches, or pulling.

How to Remove a Leech:

1. Put on a pretty frock and say: &quot;Let&#39;s go out to dinner!&quot;

2. Call a taxi. Choose a restaurant famous for its Napa Valley cuisine. Order the $65 tasting menu.

3. After dessert, when the check arrives, tell the leech, er, your boyfriend that you wish him a long and happy life, but if he can&#39;t pay for dinner—just this once—it&#39;s over. He will work his anterior (oral) sucker at top speed, jabbering excuses.

4. On the way home in the taxi, he will declare he loves you &quot;unconditionally.&quot; Never mind. Just flick him off at his parents&#39; house. (He&#39;ll be surprised to see boxes of his bongs and belongings stacked in the yard. There&#39;s no need to explain that you arranged for friends to pack his things while you were at the restaurant. Just say, &quot;Leech, the only thing you love unconditionally is my bank account.&quot;)

5. Ask the taxi driver to honk the horn as you drive away. It&#39;s your first moment of delicious, glorious freedom! (The wound will itch as it heals, so do not let the leech reattach itself.)
