Aside from being dubbed one of fashion&#39;s golden boys, Wang has rightfully earned himself a reputation also a renowned party planner and host. On Sunday, the over-the-top&#39;ness of his post-show extravaganzas will be recreated for the public, particularly those in support of Pride.

Wang said in a statement today that he&#39;s been wanting this collaboration to happen for some time now. &quot;I reached out to Trojan last year and, timing-wise, we weren&#39;t able to make it work, so this year when it came around I was like, &#39;Oh, I&#39;ve got to get back in touch with them.&#39; We&#39;ve never been able to participate in a big way with the Pride celebration, especially in New York.&quot;

True to the Alexander Wang aesthetic, the chic all-black vehicle is designed to inform the public about the necessary measures of safe sex. Although its message bares serious, its slogan, #ProtectYourWang, taps into the the provocative side of Wang that we&#39;ve been seeing more of in his recent collections (i.e. marijuana and stripper pole logos). The float mimics one of Wang&#39;s signature party buses that he&#39;s used in campaigns, equipped with all the necessities such as D.J. booths and a stripper pole.

As the fashion climate becomes increasingly political, Wang is among many in the industry to use his voice in support of the LGBTQ Community. &quot;I feel this partnership with Trojan was a positive way to reinforce the message of inclusion and promote wellness within the LGBTQ Community. I feel proud to be able to celebrate our differences and remind everyone to &#39;Protect Your Wang,&quot; he continued. Together, Wang and Trojan encourage the use of condoms, especially as the rate of those infected with STD&#39;s continue to rise. According to the most recent CDC STD surveillance report, gay and bisexual men are indeed at greater risk. A brand manager at Trojan, Stephanie Berez, chimed in for support of Wang. &quot;Alex has the power to influence many people to make positive choices regarding their sexual health and enhancing their pleasure.&quot;

In addition to the distribution of Trojan condoms and the branded temporary tattoos, guests of Wang will rep with their &quot;Protect Your Wang&quot; T-shirts designed by Alex himself. To follow the conversation, check the hashtag #WangFest on all social media outlets. The march will begin at noon on Sunday June 25th with crowds forming in Midtown around Fifth Avenue and 37th street. From there, the masses will proceed down 5th Avenue to 8th Street, before making their way to Christopher Street, and ending at Greenwich Street where they will be met with a street-fair celebration called &quot;Pridefest.&quot; It goes without saying that you need not be a member of the LGBTQ community to participate, so get our your rainbow flag and let it wave.
