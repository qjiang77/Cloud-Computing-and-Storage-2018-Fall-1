But among the glitzy guests was another famous royal family who went completely under the radar.

Unlike the British royals, the Greek royals do not obey a No Social Media rule (Meghan famously deleted all her social media accounts after becoming engaged to Prince Harry). Marie-Chantal hopped on Instagram to share a photo from the wedding alongside her daughter and other guests, with the caption, "Hat babes ðŸ’•"

In another snap, she showed her daughter and husband striking an adorable pose.
