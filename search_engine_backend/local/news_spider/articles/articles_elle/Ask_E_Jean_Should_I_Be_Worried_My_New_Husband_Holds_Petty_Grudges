Ask E.

Jean: It has been less than two months since we came home from our honeymoon, and my husband is refusing to have sex because—and it took me weeks to find this out—I made a comment in front of his family, joking about him &quot;not doing squat around the house.&quot; (He brought up the topic, but I digress.)

Marriage is supposed to be fun. Forgive and move on. And if he doesn&#39;t wise up? Do what Cathy the Great did to her hub, Czar Peter III: Chuck him in the clink, and then swear you had nothing to do with it when he croaks.
