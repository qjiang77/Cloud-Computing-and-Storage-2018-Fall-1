Jean: There&#39;s this guy I like at my company, and I&#39;m not sure he likes me in return. Here are the facts:

1. He teases me.

2. He starts conversations with me that are not necessary.

3. He touches my back sometimes.

4. He cooked me dinner twice.

5. When I compliment other male coworkers in front of him, he says my compliments are wrong.

6. When I told him he was not strong enough to lift me, he carried me halfway to my apartment.

I&#39;m 22, and he is 25. Do you think he is interested? Please help me. â€”I Need to Know

Miss Know, My Nougat: Yes. He&#39;s interested. Absolutely interested. Positively and beyond all doubt, interested, yes! (If I could get the editors to give me one more page, I&#39;d fill that with yeses, too.)
