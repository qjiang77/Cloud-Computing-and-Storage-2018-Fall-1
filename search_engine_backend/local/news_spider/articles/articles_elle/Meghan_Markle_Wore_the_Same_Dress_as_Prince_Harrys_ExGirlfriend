Meghan, who returned to the Games a year after her public debut with Harry, wore a black Emilia Wickstead Dress. The design looked familiar to some eagle-eyed fans, who pointed out that Prince Harry&#39;s ex-girlfriend Jenna Coleman wore the same design pretty recently.

In June, Jenna wore the same dress to the Cartier Trophy at the Guards Polo Club. The actress opted for the white version, while Meghan chose black and accessorized with a Philip Treacy fascinator.

Harry and Jenna reportedly dated in June 2015. According to Us Weekly, Harry &quot;wooed&quot; the actress, but would &quot;never be anything serious because of their schedules.&quot;

The dress coincidence follows Harry and Meghan&#39;s awkward run-in with Coleman at the new Soho House opening in Amsterdam a month ago. “Harry had to walk straight past Jenna to get to his and Meghan’s table,” a witness told Vanity Fair&#39;s royal correspondent Katie Nicholl. “It was pretty awkward and some of the other guests were commenting on it. Jenna looked down while Harry looked straight ahead, while Meghan didn’t seem to notice. She sat through breakfast with a smile on her face, but Harry looked a bit uncomfortable. He’d been super friendly saying hi to everyone, but he didn’t even acknowledge Jenna.”
