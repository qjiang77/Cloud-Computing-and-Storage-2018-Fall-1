Oscar de la Renta Loosens Up|http://www.elle.com/fashion-week|http://www.elle.com/runway/g23064041/oscar-de-la-renta-spring-summer-2019-review/||2018-09-12|Leah Chernikoff||It&#39;s been two years since designers Laura Kim and Fernando Garcia have led Oscar de la Renta, and in that time they&#39;ve reinvented the brand from a &quot;ladies who lunch&quot; label to a ladies who, well, do whatever they want, label. Kim and Garcia are both millennials, and they&#39;re dressing their contemporaries (Nicki Minaj and Sofia Ricci were in the front row): women who have places to go to and people to be seen by but want to be comfortable and sexy, too. Instead of prim suiting there were boho blouses and fringed sarong skirts, oversized sweaters, and fancy striped pajama sets. de la Renta&#39;s evening wear always had a wow factorâ€”dresses you could immediately envision on a red carpet. Kim and Garcia offered plenty in the way of red carpet dressing, but the drama was in the sex appeal: low v-necks, high slits, fringe, feathers, and a lot of fun.
