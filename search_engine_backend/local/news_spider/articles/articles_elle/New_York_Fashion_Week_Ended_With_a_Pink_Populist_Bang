It&#39;s quick, it&#39;s chic, and today, it&#39;s got Nicki and RiRi, so fasten your Balenciaga seatbelt and let&#39;s go!

Rihanna closed New York Fashion Week with a party for her Fenty lingerie. As an all-inclusive range for women in every size and shade of nude (believe us, we checked...), it&#39;s already one of our favorite brands.

But last night&#39;s bash made it even more special, thanks to models that ran the gamut in age, shape, and size. From California bombshells like Gigi and Bella to pregnant, power-posing Slick Woods, the presentation proved that inclusion isn&#39;t just good for business—it&#39;s also the sexiest thing in fashion.

Marc Jacobs made a dreamscape at the Park Avenue Armory, with a pastel takeover that stunned the audience and lured Nicki Minaj and Emily Ratajkowski front row. But it was the double pink punch of Mariana Zaragoza&#39;s swingy ponytail and Adwoa Aboah&#39;s one and only New York catwalk appearance that really made my night.

This is Kim Petras, a German pop starlet and LGBTQ activist who has been living her best life at New York Fashion Week. Here she is at... deep breath... Christian Siriano, Opening Ceremony, Tommy Hilfiger x Lewis Hamilton, Christian Cowan, Anna Sui, and Marc Jacobs. Phew! Thanks KP for loving fashion so hard, you make us love it, too.

Another front row staple this season? TWINS. Witness the Instagram sirens Molly + Reese Blutstein, Shannon + Shennade Clermont, Shelcy + Christy Joseph, Cailli + Sam Beckerman, and Cipriana Quann + TK Wonder for proof. Sisterhood is powerful... and apparently gets a lot of &quot;likes,&quot; too.

Speaking of twinning, check out Bella Hadid at Anna Sui next to Sara Grace Wallerstedt at Michael Kors. If anything gets us excited to shop next season, it&#39;s mermaids, so please put us on the waiting list for both these splashy looks!

Michael Kors also made a cool move this season with a short-sleeve leather jacket and a cropped-sleeve jacquard blazer. Considering the ever-shifting weather, this layering trick is quite brilliant, and the jackets themselves? Perfection. Well done, Mr. Kors and good bye New York! Next up: London. Stay tuned...
