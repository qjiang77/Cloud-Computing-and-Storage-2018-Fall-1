"When I met her, she was such a sweet, adorable person. She's really what you see. She's really a sweetheart," she said. "I just want to let her know, Girl, you're beautiful, you're rich and hold on because even sometimes I feel like I'm losing my mind. I just got to pray hard to God and get away from social media."

Selena was reportedly hospitalized twice recently due to complications with her kidney transplant. The singer, alarmed by a low white blood cell count, suffered a panic attack and is now seeking mental health treatment according to People. "She has had a tough few weeks and the panic attack in the hospital was the tipping point," a source said. "She realized she needed to seek additional help for her ongoing emotional issues. She’s doing better now and is seeking treatment on the East Coast.”
