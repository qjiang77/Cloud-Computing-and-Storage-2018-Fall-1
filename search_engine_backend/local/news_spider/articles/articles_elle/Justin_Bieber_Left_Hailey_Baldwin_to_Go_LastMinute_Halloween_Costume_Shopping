Bieber, who&#39;s currently choosing what LA property to buy too, was unable to commit to a costume during his solo shopping trip. It&#39;s a hard choice, especially when you are rich enough to buy out the entire store. But Page Six notes that Bieber &quot;took particular interest in a ringleader outfit,&quot; so there&#39;s something. Bieber was not, however, looking for a couple&#39;s costume, per Page Six. Maybe because Jailey in&#39;t feeling it, or maybe Baldwin is just the kind of girl who already has her outfit all picked out. You know or are the type.
