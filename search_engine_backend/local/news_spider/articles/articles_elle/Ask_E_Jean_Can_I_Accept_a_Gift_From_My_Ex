Ask E. Jean: Can I Accept a Gift From My Ex?|http://www.elle.com/life-love|http://www.elle.com/life-love/ask-e-jean/advice/a14866/ask-e-jean-can-i-accept-a-gift-from-my-ex/||2018-10-16|E. Jean||Dear E. Jean: I had an on-and-off boyfriend of two years whom I loved, but I ultimately realized the relationship was not working. I ended it several months ago and moved on. He now lives in Rome but came to New York this week for work. He suggested we catch up over dinner, which I agreed to do, on the condition that we keep it strictly platonic. He concurred—we met, dined, and had a great time. Afterward, he presented me with a diamond necklace. I flatly told him I could not date or marry him, and he said he didn&#39;t care—he just wanted me to have it.

Obviously I&#39;m blindsided and completely unsure of what to do. What would you suggest? —In Up to My Neck

Up, My Nectarine: Oh, dear. This is one of those questions where I give you The One Great True Answer, the exact opposite of which is also The One Great True Answer.

In my experience, accepting a gift from a chap is a polite way of saying that he may now introduce you to his erection. In the experience of Miss Lisa Chase, editor of this column, however, refusing a spanking-new Vortex-blue Volkswagen Beetle, presented to her by Peter Kaplan, the fabled New York Observer editor, only increased Mr. Kaplan&#39;s desire. (She told him she couldn&#39;t accept such a big gift unless they were at least living together. So they did cohabitate, she accepted the car, and, reader, she married him…12 years later.)

Then there&#39;s the experience of my good friend, deputy editor of Jezebel Dodai Stewart, a woman who walks around Manhattan with her hands behind her back because so many chaps surprise her with engagement rings, and who says she &quot;never looks a gift diamond in the mouth.&quot;

Dodai emailed me later to say, &quot;I&#39;m a little worried about that [gift-diamond-in-the-mouth] quote. Does it sound avaricious and money-grubbing? I meant it more like: &#39;If the dude wants to try bribery with a bauble, who are you to argue?&#39; That said, the resale value of diamonds is notoriously pathetic. I guess it depends on what it really means. Regardless of the carat weight, the lady in question may find that the emotional weight is far too heavy.&quot;

Upon reflection, it seems both Lisa and Dodai came to the same conclusion: If you accept a big gift, you must accept that it usually comes with consequences. Take the necklace and the lad will go on loving you; refuse it and the lad may go on loving you, so to avoid distress of conscience the next time a chap gives you diamonds, rubies, or emeralds, just FedEx them to me.
