Ask E. Jean: My Husband Fantasizes About Other Women|http://www.elle.com/life-love|http://www.elle.com/life-love/ask-e-jean/advice/a14827/ask-e-jean-my-husband-fantasizes-about-other-women/||2018-10-10|E. Jean||Dear E. Jean: I&#39;m a landscape designer, happily married for eight years. My husband is a really good man, and I&#39;m not a possessive or jealous woman, believe me. But: He can become aroused only if he&#39;s thinking of another woman and is able to orgasm only if he shouts out her name loudly.

I have repeatedly told him that I don&#39;t like it, but it makes no difference. Worse, the women he fantasizes about are sometimes people I know well. I&#39;m totally into sexual experimentation, but this is ridiculous! Please help. â€”Sick of It!

My Dear Ms. Sick of It: Ninety-nine percent of men after eight years of marriage are fantasizing about other women; the other one percent are dead. But it&#39;s one thing to think about other women; it&#39;s another to bellow out their names whilst boffing. So tell him, &quot;Shut up, buddy.&quot; Take his dinner napkin. Fold it. Gag him. Have fun!
