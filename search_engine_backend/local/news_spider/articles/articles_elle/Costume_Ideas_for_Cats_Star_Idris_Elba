Costume Ideas for Cats Star Idris Elba|http://www.elle.com|http://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/a23865467/idris-elba-cast-in-cats-movie/||2018-10-17|R. Eric Thomas||Yesterday, news broke that Gravel-Voiced Zaddy Idris Elba is bringing his snack buffet to Tom Hooper&#39;s new film version of Cats. As a Snack Cat. A kibble (or a bit). Producers have not announced which cat he&#39;ll play, but let me be the first to say I don&#39;t care at all. Idris is going to throw on some spandex and sing and maybe lick himself a little bit and I&#39;m putting myself on bed rest from the excitement. What cat is he playing in Cats? The cat of my dreams. Idris Elba could play Garfield and I&#39;d be like, &quot;Yas, zaddy, cancel Mondays! Smother me with lasagna! Nermal is a narc!&quot;

Idris Elba doesn&#39;t even have to be playing a cat at all. He can play anything he wants. Idris Elba could get cast as the plums that were in the icebox which you were probably saving, and I&#39;d be like, &quot;This is just to say, Idris is delicious. Give him a Golden Globe.&quot;

Idris joins previously announced castmates Jennifer Hudson, Taylor Swift, and James Corden in the big-screen take on the long-running musical about alley cats, their existential crises, and how high they can jump. Confidential between you, me, and Taylor&#39;s voting record, I really don&#39;t understand how this movie is going to work. Will the performers be doing motion capture? Will it be animated? Will there be wigs?!

They are humans playing actual li&#39;l kitty cats, and I just have a lot of questions from a basic, logistical point of view.

But let&#39;s presume that this will be a live-action film in which Taylor Swift and James Corden put on furry coats and learn feline choreography. What will Idris wear? Well, it turns out he&#39;s been cosplaying the Cats lewk for years:

But one fur-lined collar does not a Cats cat make. What is he, playing Natasha in The Great Comet? (Would watch.) Noâ€”Cats, the musical, is probably best known for its striped and calico&#39;d skintight outfits, and I am praying to all that is holy that Idris will soon squeeze all 6&#39;3&quot; of his scrumptious goodness into a size extra-sexy spandex body-oddy-oddy-suit. The public needs it.

In order to give Idris a better sense of what that might look like, I was going to Photoshop Idris&#39; head on to the body of a bunch of models wearing spandex tights or bodysuits, but then I was like, &quot;What if I just posted some pictures of spandex tights and bodysuits and then accompanied them with shirtless GIFs of Idris Elba and everyone just uses their imagination to combine the two?&quot;

This is truly investigative journalism.

Okay!

Here&#39;s a bodysuit that is telling a color story which maybe isn&#39;t cat-adjacent, but I feel like Idris should screen test it just in case.

Hmm, I may have gotten distracted. The fact is, Idris Elba looks damn delicious in anything, but let&#39;s put him in some cat spandex, just to be sure.
