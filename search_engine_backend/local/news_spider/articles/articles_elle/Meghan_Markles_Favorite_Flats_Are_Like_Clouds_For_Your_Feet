Meghan Markle's Favorite Flats Are Like Clouds For Your Feet|http://www.elle.com|http://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a23939667/meghan-markles-favorite-flats-are-like-clouds-for-your-feet/||2018-10-19|Holly Rhue||I will shamelessly do anything that Meghan Markle does. Dior pantsuit? Here&#39;s my credit card. Trench dress? Get me to Burberry, stat. Marrying a prince IRL? I&#39;m working on it okay, Mom, so just relax!

I&#39;m also all about feeling comfy cozy in all situations, so when I happened upon a picture of Meghan Markle wearing glorified SLIPPERS that could pass as flats on her since-deleted Instagram back in 2016, I was forced to do some digging (I mean come on...slippers! As shoes!)

Upon closer inspection of her feed, I noticed that Meghan had actually posted a few photos wearing the same pair of velvety flats. She wore them on the set of Suits. She wore them to the airport. She wore them to London on visits with Prince Harry. (Did he fall in love with her for her practical shoes alone? Honestly, maybe.)

For two years, I could not for the life of me figure out where to find them until last month—as evidence that there is a higher power—my personal FBI agent hit my Instagram feed with a sponsored photo of Meghan wearing the shoes (which was posted by the brand: Birdies). And thus, an obsession was born.

I promptly ignored all of my responsibilities and headed to the Birdies website. And not to be dramatic, but when the page loaded, my life flashed before my eyes. There were SO many styles, all designed to be a flat-slipper hybrid with quilted, padded soles so you get all of the comfort of wearing slippers, minus the judgement.

In the photo I saw on the Birdies Instagram, Meghan was wearing a pair that most closely resembled The Starling style. So ya know...I got those. I went for a backless style called The Phoebe as well, because they have chic little bows that make me feel like a lazy Audrey Hepburn (one of Meghan&#39;s style icons). Once they arrived, I was basically prepared to star in my own feature film: Breakfast At Tiffany&#39;s The Comfort Of My Own Home And Nowhere Else.

To give you an idea of how comfortable these babies are, let me start by telling you that I&#39;m one of those people who complains about standing for more than 10 minutes. I also blister like crazy anytime I try to wear new shoes. But on the first day of wearing my Birdies...I used my standing desk at work. For three hours. After that, my friend invited me for drinks on the other side of town, and I walked a mile in The Starling with zero complaints (or blisters). The quilted sole feels like my own personal cloud, and my feet don&#39;t ache at the end of the day like they normally do.

These shoes have become a staple of my wardrobe for fall, and all I can say is thank you, Meghan Markle! Shop more Birdies below.
