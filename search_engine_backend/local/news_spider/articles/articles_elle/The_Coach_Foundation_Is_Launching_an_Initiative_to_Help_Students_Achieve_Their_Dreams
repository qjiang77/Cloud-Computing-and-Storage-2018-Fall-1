The Future Project launched in 2011 on a mission to &quot;inspire, equip, and connect people to discover their power and use it to build a better future,&quot; according to the official site. As part of Coach&#39;s Dream It Real initiative, The Future Project will place &quot;dream directors&quot; (aka mentors) who are trained coaches, leaders, and organizers into schools to help students create Future Projects that bring their wildest dreams to life. Added bonus? Coach ambassadors Michael B. Jordan and Selena Gomez will also serve as honorary dream directors and make appearances at a few schools throughout the year.

“Today, we are proud to stand behind a mission to inspire and equip young people to take steps toward finding their passion and purpose,” said Joshua Schulman, CEO and president of Coach. “Together, our employees and our associates are a community united by our shared desire to achieve our dreams – and to help others achieve theirs.”

In addition to Jordan and Gomez&#39;s commitment, the Coach Foundation has also donated $1.4 million to help further The Future Project&#39;s efforts to support Dream Directors nationwide.

“Virtually every movement in history has been led by young people – and, today, we need their leadership more than ever,” said Kanya Balakrishna, CEO and co-founder of The Future Project. “We are proud to partner with Coach, a brand that is willing to stand behind the unlimited potential of a generation.”

To celebrate the launch of Dream It Real and its partnership with The Future Project, Coach unveiled a short-film directed by Tyler Mitchell, you know, the 23-year-old photographer who shot Beyonce for Vogue and made history as the first(!) black photographer to shoot the publication&#39;s cover, ever. The short film follows the students in The Future Project, as they open up about their dreams and what&#39;s in store for the future.
