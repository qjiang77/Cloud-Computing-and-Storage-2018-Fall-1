Since Kensington Palace announced that Meghan Markle is expecting her first child, the royal has said the most heartfelt things about Meghan and the royal baby while on Australian tour.

Earlier this week, Harry appeared on Good Morning America and excitedly thanked a room full of Aussie officials for their support and well-wishes. &quot;Thank you for the incredibly warm welcome and the chance to meet so many Aussies from all walks of life...we also genuinely couldn&#39;t think of a better place to announce the...upcoming baby, whether it be a boy or a girl,&quot; he said. &quot;So thank you very, very much.&quot; Meghan was also shown smiling and applauding.

And today, during his Invictus Games Opening Ceremony speech, Harry couldn&#39;t help but share the happy news again. &quot;First of all, thank you for the welcome you have given Meghan and I over the last few days,&quot; he told participants, staff and volunteers in Sydney per Hello!. &quot;I have been so proud to be able to introduce my wife to you and we have been so happy to be able to celebrate the personal joy of our newest addition with you all.&quot;

The royal addressed the crowd before artists and dancers performed at the Sydney Opera House. Leading up to his speech, Harry practiced in front of Meghan.

Almost time for @InvictusSydney...
