Multiple sources close to the couple told TMZ that the decision was made this weekend and that both Grande and Davidson agreed "it simply was not the right time for their relationship to take off," per TMZ. "We're told the two still have love for each other, but things are over romantically."

“It was way too much too soon,” a source close to Grande additionally told People. “It’s not shocking to anyone.”

The two have not ruled out the idea of a reconciliation down the line, however. Grande and Davidson started dating in May shortly after both Grande and Davidson got out of other long term relationships (Davidson with Cazzie David, Grande with Mac Miller, who last month tragically passed away). On the day of their first date, Grande was apparently ring shopping. As Davidson told Allie Jones for GQ's September issue. "The day I met her, I was like, 'Hey, I'll marry you tomorrow,'" he said with a grin. "She was calling my bluff. I sent her a picture [of engagement rings]. I was like, 'Do you like any of these?' She was like, 'Those are my favorite ones,' and I was like, 'Sick.'"

Davidson and Grande have both gotten numerous tattoos inspired by each other. The two were most recently seen together this week. Neither have commented on the breakup report, with Grande's last Instagram post having appeared two days ago.
