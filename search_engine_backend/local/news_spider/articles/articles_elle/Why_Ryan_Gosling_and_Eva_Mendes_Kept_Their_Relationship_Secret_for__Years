The super secretive pair have always been private and despite Ryan's promotion for his new film First Man, don't expect them to make any public appearances.

According to People, the couple are more about concentrating on their relationship and careers. "They love and respect each other and try to give the other space to pursue what they love,” a source said. Ryan loves how “fiercely independent” Mendes is, but it can sometimes be “challenging.”

Another source adds that they're very preoccupied with raising two young daughters. "They spend every second they can with Esmeralda Amada and Amada Lee."

The couple first met on the set of The Place Beyond the Pines and sent romance rumors flying in September 2011, during a cozy trip to Disneyland. Over the years, Eva and Ryan have kept things as normal as possible, making their arguments pretty common. “Like any couple they have disagreements," a source revealed. "Now the children come first, and they share a love for them which neither had experienced before."
