Would she opt for a traditional long-sleeved lace like gown Kate Middleton’s McQueen, be inspired by Meghan’s classic silhouetted Givenchy, or stay true to her unique personal style with a modern look?

As Princess Eugenie ascended the steps of Windsor, her Peter Pilotto dress left the public in awe for more reasons than one. The off the shoulder gown cascaded down her back in a deep v to reveal her childhood Scoliosis scar. For many women, it was courageous and inspiring to see a Princess openly embrace her scar.

UK photographer Sophie Mayanne has been documenting women across all continents embracing their own scars in her “Behind The Scars” photo series.

&quot;As a photographer I have always been drawn to what makes us unique, and different to one another,&quot; Mayanne said. &quot;Beauty is something that has always interested me, and I like to find beauty which can be overlooked.&quot;

Of the origins of the series, which began in April 2017, Mayanne said, &quot;Behind The Scars started off as a small idea to create a set of portraits that explored the idea of someone&#39;s history—exploring the person wearing the scar, and their story behind it. Since then the project has grown, and I&#39;ve found myself face to face with many incredible subjects in the studio. I capture people&#39;s vulnerability, resilience, beauty, thoughts—and get to showcase their stories in an incredible way. Being able to show someone a new view of themselves through the camera has an impact—and their courage helps others out there too.&quot;

Upon seeing Princess Eugenie bravely display her own scar, Sophie Mayanne stated “I think Princess Eugenie showing her scar is a great step forward—and can help many people with similar scars, or people who will obtain the same scar in the future. There may be young girls out there with the same scar who could feel more confident and free when choosing clothing—or a prom dress, or their own wedding dress. I think it&#39;s great that she is proud of her scar, and she is choosing to show it on her own terms.”

Sophie&#39;s photos not only capture women&#39;s struggles but their resilience and ability to shine through despite them.

“In 2013 at 25, and 1 year into my modelling career I was diagnosed with advanced (Stage 3) low-grade serous carcinoma. I received 3 months of Chemo and had over 22 hours of operations. My scar has really become a big part of me, and my cancer.

Instead of letting it destroy my life and dream, I embraced it and used it to help others. My choice to model through cancer was freeing. My scars are my trademark, my beauty mark and the reason I am alive today. I’m so thankful for the awareness this mark has allowed me to make.”

“I started self-harming when I was around 11 years old. It started off as a response to the overwhelming feelings that I was experiencing. To be honest, I didn’t understand exactly what the first trigger was - I just knew it was something that made me feel “better”. It quickly spiraled into an addiction and I didn’t know how to stop. The scars piled up on my arms and legs and other people started to notice. I felt ugly, grotesque and ashamed. Strangers on the street would question me relentlessly about them - and when the weather got hot - I knew I needed to cover them up, through fear of judgement. So for years all I wore were long sleeves and jeans. At times I feel guilty because the scars are self inflicted - but I am happy to say that I am now fully recovered. Even though I will always have these permanent scars on my body, they serve as a reminder to the battles I have fought and won. I am proud to show the world that it is okay to have scars - no matter where they have come from.”

“I was diagnosed with Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) when I was 18 months old. EB is a rare genetic condition which causes the skin to blister and tear at the slightest touch. Due to the sensitivity of my skin, over the years I have gained many scars. The condition also causes internal problems, including a narrowing of the oesophagus which results in difficulties swallowing food. I have always been self conscious and ashamed of it, until very recently when I decided to embrace it and not let it hold me back from living life to the fullest.”

“I played with a hand gun at age 14 and it gave me a lifetime in a wheelchair. But despite what you might think, I’ve never found a reason to be victimized by my condition. My spiritual and physical scars made me grow stronger, empowered. I wanted to be a tennis player, so I became a tennis player. I wanted to be a model, and guess what... I am a model. As a model of diversity, I work in the fashion industry representing people that have limitations but are not limited. They love, they fight, they win, they lose. They are real and my story helps them to see how beautiful and meaningful they are. All scars included.&quot;

“I was about 2 sitting in a high chair at a table for a wedding party. A waiter serving hot water walked by and tripped on a cable and spilled it all over me. My mom ripped of all my clothes but some of my skin on my right shoulder melted onto my clothes.

I passed out. When I became conscious I was already in a van and all my relatives were trying to find a hospital open at midnight in Bangkok, Thailand. When we did arrive at one the nurses did not know what to do until the doctors came in so they started peeling the dead skin off my body. The next day the doctors took me in for surgery. It has been 23 years since the event. I must say I am blessed.”

“My scars are from a fire related to domestic abuse. I got burnt at the age of 29, and it’s been a difficult journey coming to terms with it. The comfort I take from my scars is they make me who I am today. I call them my most precious, and expensive piece of jewellery I own.

I have survived and if having my picture taken, and exposing my scars can help anyone else then that’s good for me!”

“Within one hour after an uncomplicated pregnancy, and a natural child birth, I began to turn blue. The doctors did not know what was wrong, but suspected it was my heart. Thankfully there was a pediatric cardiologist that had moved to the small N.C town where I was born, and he told them to give me a drug called Prostaglandin to keep me alive until they could fly me by helicopter to Duke University Medical Center. There I was diagnosed with a rare, and severe heart defect called Ebstein Anomaly of the tricuspid valve, with hypo plastic right ventricle and pulmonary artery stenosis. At eight days old I had my first open heart surgery to place a temporary Gore-Tex shunt called a Blalock-Taussig shunt to give me more oxygenated blood to survive. Because of my very tiny pulmonary arteries the doctors told my parents there was nothing else they could do, and did not give them much hope. I could not survive having the normal bypass surgery called a Glenn Shunt.

Over the next five years I had several heart catherizations with balloons to try and dilate my tiny arteries for surgical repair. A lot of people were praying for a miracle for me, as the doctors did not think I would survive as long as I had already. When I was 5 years old, and my oxygen was really low something had to be done. My mum got a call from a pediatric heart surgeon from New Zealand that had moved to Cleveland Clinic to work. My doctor from Duke sent all my records to him trying find help for me because he loved me. Dr. Mee had a creative idea to help me, and off we were for my second open heart surgery. The surgery was a success, but after I began to collect fluid around my lungs and they had to keep putting drainage tubes in my sides again and again. Finally Dr. Mee decided he had to do a lung surgery called Pleurodesis to prevent any more build up of fluid. It required opening up my sides and scrubbing my lungs raw so they would stick to my chest wall. I had to fast with no water or food for 6 days. It was torture, but it saved my life. Two years ago I had my scars revised by a plastic surgeon because I was tried of people staring at them instead of my face. It even gave boys an excuse to share at my chest! Needless to say some of them healed, but the one down my chest became more red. Now I am done with surgeries (of all kinds!) and I am at peace with my scars.

“I was diagnosed with breast cancer at 39 ears old, with no family history and no clue. I was an executive, an entrepreneur and an educator - married with 2 kids. Never in my life did I think I would pose half naked - but I also never thought I would get breast cancer!

I had a bilateral mastectomy and lymph node removed. I decided not to reconstruct. It is a personal decision and despite people telling me I would regret it, I do not. I bare my scars for all those who feel less than. I am still feminine - I’m not an exhibitionist, but I want others who find themselves to be the 1 in 8 to know that life goes on. That beauty is strength, and cancer does not mean that life is over. I hope that seeing my body honestly, and my smile and happiness to still be here helps you embrace your body. Whether you have 1 boob, no boobs or whatever - cancer made me scared. It made me hide, made me lose my voice - but I am taking it all back. To be fearless, and to use my voice. And of course, to have hair again!”
