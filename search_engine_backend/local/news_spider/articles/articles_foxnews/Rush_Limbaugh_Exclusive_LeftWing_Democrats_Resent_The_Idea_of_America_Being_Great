Limbaugh said that many in the Democratic Party and the far-left do not want America to retain its status as a world superpower.

&quot;They don&#39;t even want to make America great. They resent this whole idea of America becoming great,&quot; Limbaugh said.

&quot;We hold the House and we increase the Senate, because I think that’s justice.&quot; TONIGHT: @rushlimbaugh sits down with @seanhannity to give his predictions for the midterm elections.

&quot;We&#39;re the good guys. They don&#39;t think so.&quot;

Limbaugh said he &quot;shudders&quot; when he thinks of what a &#39;President Hillary Clinton&#39; would have done to America&#39;s standing in the world.

&quot;All her cronies [would be] in all the cabinet positions and the validation of all these oddball, weird [and] perverted left wing behaviors [would become] more and more normalized,&quot; he said.

He said the left has made America into a country consisting of &quot;nothing but a bunch of victims, constantly angry and demanding that somebody do something about it -- instead of all of us... using self-reliance and our own initiative to handle life ourselves.&quot;

Limbaugh added that Democrats have &quot;thrown everything at Trump&quot; that would normally cause a Republican to back down, but that the president&#39;s resilience has forced the left to &quot;overplay&quot; their hands.

&quot;They hate him, they despise him,&quot; he said. &quot;This is going way over the bounds... of propriety.&quot;
