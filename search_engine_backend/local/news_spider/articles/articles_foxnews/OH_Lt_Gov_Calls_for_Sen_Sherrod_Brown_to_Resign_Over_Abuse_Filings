OH Lt. Gov. Calls for Sen. Sherrod Brown to Resign Over Abuse Filings|http://insider.foxnews.com|http://insider.foxnews.com/2018/10/12/metoo-republican-calls-ohio-sen-sherrod-brown-resign-over-abuse-court-filings|Judge Jeanine,MeToo|2018-10-12|||Ohio's Republican lieutenant governor renewed her call for Sen. Sherrod Brown to resign in the wake of court records that purport alleged spousal abuse and at least one restraining order filed against him by his now-ex-wife.

Ed Henry reported that Lt. Gov. Mary Taylor leads a "#MeToo"-type group that has been pressing for Brown (D-Ohio) to be held accountable, as the Democratic #MeToo proponents have called for similar actions in relation to allegations against Justice Brett Kavanaugh.

"The Democrats have to end this hypocrisy," Taylor said on "The Story."

Brown currently leads Republican Rep. Jim Renacci by 16 points in the race for Senate, according to the RealClearPolitics polling average.

"[Democrats] are OK with certain things as long as it's defending the right person," Taylor said, adding that it is hypocritical for Brown to fight against Kavanaugh's nomination.

Taylor said there are court records that show Brown has been the subject of court filings involving abuse from his ex-wife, Larke Recchie.

However, Recchie endorsed Brown in a recent ad, and slammed Renacci.

"Divorce can be difficult and ours was no different," Recchie said.

Brown called the situation a "family matter."

Taylor told Henry that either way, "it's time for Sherrod Brown to be held accountable for his actions."
