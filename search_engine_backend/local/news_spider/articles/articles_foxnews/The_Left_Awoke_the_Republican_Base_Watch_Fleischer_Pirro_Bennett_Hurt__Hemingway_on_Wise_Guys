The Left 'Awoke the Republican Base': Watch Fleischer, Pirro, Bennett, Hurt & Hemingway on 'Wise Guys'|http://insider.foxnews.com|http://insider.foxnews.com/2018/10/20/ari-fleischer-jeanine-pirro-bill-bennett-charles-hurt-mollie-hemingway-wise-guys|Bill Bennett,Judge Jeanine,Charles Hurt,Mollie Hemingway|2018-10-20|||The roundtable on this Sunday&#39;s episode of &quot;The Wise Guys&quot; will discuss the significance of the Kavanaugh hearings, the upcoming midterm elections, President Trumpâ€™s legacy and more.

The discussion will be moderated by former Secretary of Education Dr. Bill Bennett, and co-panelists will include former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer, The Federalist senior editor Mollie Hemingway, Washington Times opinion editor Charles Hurt and Justice With Judge Jeanine host Jeanine Pirro.

In a preview clip, Fleischer said that a result of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh&#39;s confirmation process was the awakening of the Republican base.

&quot;This has put Republicans in a much stronger position for the 2018 midterms,&quot; he added.

Fleischer also said that he was largely disappointed at the way Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) handled Christine Blasey Ford&#39;s initial claim of sexual misconduct from Kavanaugh.

&quot;The right moral thing to do would have been to act immediately upon receipt of that letter,&quot; he said.

Pirro added that Feinstein only needed to follow a &quot;simple&quot; process in dealing with Ford&#39;s accusations.

&quot;She didn&#39;t have to recreate the wheel here,&quot; she said. &quot;They could have done it quietly. They could have done it behind the scenes. This isn&#39;t something that they haven&#39;t dealt with before.&quot;
