'A Caravan of Lies and Manipulation': Ingraham Blasts Left & Media's Narrative on Illegal Immigration|http://insider.foxnews.com|http://insider.foxnews.com/2018/10/19/laura-ingraham-lefts-caravan-lies-and-manipulation-illegal-immigration|Judge Jeanine|2018-10-19|||Laura Ingraham called out the &quot;caravan of lies and manipulation&quot; put forth by Democrats and the mainstream media on illegal immigration.

In her Thursday night monologue, Ingraham highlighted the caravan of 4,000 Central American migrants heading to the U.S. from Honduras.

She said it started as a group of 1,600 and quickly grew to 4,000 as the media fed into a narrative that those who refuse to welcome the migrants &quot;are cruel, horrible, rotten people.&quot;

CNN anchor Chris Cuomo claimed Republicans are trying to convince voters that the &quot;scary people from the south are coming for you&quot; and want voters to see immigrants as &quot;different [and] not as civilized as you.&quot;

&quot;The media&#39;s over-the top slurs against those of us who believe the system must change and the border must be protected speaks volumes about their bias and their real motivation, which is to help Democrats,&quot; she said.

Ingraham questioned why Democrats never bring up Americans who have been killed by criminal aliens in the United States.

&quot;Not all illegal immigrants commit violent crime and many are good and hardworking people, but that&#39;s not really the point. No American should suffer or be brutalized in order to fulfill the Democrats&#39; fantasy of a borderless society,&quot; she said, adding American workers should not have their wages lowered because of cheaper, illegal immigrant labor.

Ingraham said President Trump &quot;finally&quot; wants to tackle the problem instead of passing it to the next president, as Barack Obama. She said Americans &quot;treasure&quot; Hispanic residents who came here legally, noting the many calls she receives on her radio show from &quot;enraged&quot; legal immigrants.
