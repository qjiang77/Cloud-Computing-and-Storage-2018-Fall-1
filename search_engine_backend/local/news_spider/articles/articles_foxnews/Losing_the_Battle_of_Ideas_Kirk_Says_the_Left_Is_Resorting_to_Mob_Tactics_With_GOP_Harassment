'Losing the Battle of Ideas': Kirk Says the Left Is Resorting to 'Mob Tactics' With GOP Harassment|http://insider.foxnews.com|http://insider.foxnews.com/2018/10/21/charlie-kirk-says-left-resorting-mob-tactics-gop-harassment|Charlie Kirk,Judge Jeanine,Mitch McConnell,Ted Cruz|2018-10-21|||Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk said Sunday on Fox & Friends that the left is resorting to &quot;mob tactics&quot; with their harassment of Republican officials.

On Friday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was confronted at a restaurant by a small group of diners.

Thought many others in the Louisville, Kentucky, eatery told the group to leave McConnell alone, it marks the latest confrontation of a GOP official.

Kirk said on Sunday that strategy is a growing trend and that those on the left &quot;are losing the battle of ideas.&quot;

&quot;They&#39;re resorting these mob tactics to try to intimidate Republican congressmen and senators,&quot; he said.

Kirk noted the defacing of the New York City GOP headquarters and the harassment of Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) at a Washington, D.C. restaurant as more recent examples of the left&#39;s tactics.

&quot;The Democrat mob know they&#39;re losing, but this is a harbinger of things to come if we give power back to the Democrats.&quot;

He added that the result of a potential takeover of the House by Democrats in November would be &quot;bedlam.&quot;

&quot;This is what the left does. They intimidate, the demagogue, they smear and they lie [about] political opponents.&quot;
