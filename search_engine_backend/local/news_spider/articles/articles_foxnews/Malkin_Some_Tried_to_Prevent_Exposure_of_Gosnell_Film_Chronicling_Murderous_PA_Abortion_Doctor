Malkin: 'Some Tried to Prevent' Exposure of 'Gosnell' Film Chronicling Murderous PA Abortion Doctor|http://insider.foxnews.com|http://insider.foxnews.com/2018/10/18/gosnell-movie-suppressed-hollywood-media-michelle-malkin-says|Judge Jeanine,Kermit Gosnell|2018-10-18|||Author Michelle Malkin, a vocal proponent of the independent film &quot;Gosnell&quot; that premiered last weekend, said the movie is a &quot;hit&quot; despite repeated attempts to suppress its story from being disseminated.

The film depicts real-life abortion doctor Kermit B. Gosnell, who operated a clinic in an impoverished section of West Philadelphia for decades -- before federal authorities stumbled upon massive amounts of baby parts and filthy equipment while making a drug bust.

The federal authorities suspected Gosnell was illegally prescribing hundreds of vials of medications fraudulently, but as Dean Cain&#39;s character in the film is seen finding instead, Gosnell had been running a much more grisly enterprise.

&quot;Some have tried to prevent this pro-life movie from becoming a hit,&quot; Malkin, who was at the premiere last weekend, said on &quot;The Story.&quot;

The real-life Gosnell was found to have employed unlicensed young people as nurses and had engaged in what was called &quot;snipping&quot; -- severing the spinal cord of premature, but delivered, fetuses.

Malkin called the film&#39;s unexpected success in the face of several roadblocks &quot;a testament to the force of nature that [filmmakers] Phelim McAleer and Ann McElhinney, and a lot of very brave people in Hollywood [who put their names on the film].&quot;

Malkin called Gosnell, who is serving life in prison in Huntingdon County, Pa., one of the &quot;worst serial killers in America.&quot;

&quot;Most of the media and Hollywood have a grotesque fascination with serial killers. No one wanted to talk about Kermit Gosnell because they don&#39;t want to shed any negative exposure on abortion,&quot; she said.

Gosnell&#39;s now-defunct &quot;Women&#39;s Medical Society&quot; clinic, at 3801 Lancaster Ave in the Mantua area, sits vacant and reportedly in legal uncertainty, as one of his many reported homes is in similar shape nearby.
