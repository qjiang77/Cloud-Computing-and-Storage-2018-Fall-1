On how the interview came together: We had reached out many times so we gotten a sort of " sure we are working on it" kind of thing. Then my phone rang a few hours before the show and it was a number I didn't recognize so I didn't pick it up and it was the White House. So they got in touch with the rest of our team and said "the President would like to call in tonight" and we were like ok that sounds interesting. They said we would have 15 minutes, but we kept him for 20. We didn't have a lot of time to think about it. When you normally do these type of interviews you brainstorm on questions and have 5-6 people are involved and I thought ok what do we have to talk about. I thought I will just keep asking questions until he got to go. (1:30)

On debating others on ideas You are never going to sway somebody by calling names or threatening violence that's never gonna change someone's position but if you can have conversations about it you can't test your own view point and you can't convince anyone else of your point if you start with name calling or demeaning.
