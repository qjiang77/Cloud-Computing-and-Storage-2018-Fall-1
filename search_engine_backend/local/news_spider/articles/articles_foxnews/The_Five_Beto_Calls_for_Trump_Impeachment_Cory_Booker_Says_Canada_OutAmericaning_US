The Five: Beto Calls for Trump Impeachment, Cory Booker Says Canada 'Out-Americaning' US|http://insider.foxnews.com|http://insider.foxnews.com/2018/10/19/beto-orourke-calls-donald-trumps-impeachment-cory-booker-rips-america|Judge Jeanine,Beto O'Rourke|2018-10-19|||The panel on &quot;The Five&quot; reacted to several Democrats making politically charged remarks about President Trump and the United States this week.

Speaking at a CNN town hall, El Paso, Texas, Congressman Beto O&#39;Rourke -- who is challenging Sen. Ted Cruz in the Texas Senate race -- said it is appropriate to seek impeachment proceedings against Trump.

&quot;I would liken impeachment to indictment,&quot; O&#39;Rourke said. &quot;There is enough there to proceed with a trial.&quot;

Meanwhile, during a speech in Richland County, S.C., Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) said he is disheartened that Canada is &quot;out-Americaning&quot; the United States.

Booker said that Canada and Germany&#39;s policies allow their citizens to attend college at a much lower cost based on median income.

&quot;I can&#39;t stand how Canada is out-Americaning us,&quot; he said.

And at the 92nd Street YMCA in New York, House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi said that she does not care if some more moderate Democrats lose in November -- calling it &quot;collateral damage&quot; in pursuit of forwarding their current political ideology.

Greg Gutfeld said that it&#39;s &quot;really hard to find out what the Democrats are &#39;for&#39;.&quot;

&quot;You can only find out what they are &#39;against&#39; -- [President Trump] and being out of power,&quot; he said, calling Pelosi&#39;s comments &quot;loathsome.&quot;

Jesse Watters called the montage a &quot;smorgasbord of Democrats trying to grasp at anything.&quot;
