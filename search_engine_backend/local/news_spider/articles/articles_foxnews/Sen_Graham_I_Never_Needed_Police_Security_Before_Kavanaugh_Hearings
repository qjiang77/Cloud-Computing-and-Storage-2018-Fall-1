Sen. Graham: I Never Needed Police Security Before Kavanaugh Hearings|http://insider.foxnews.com|http://insider.foxnews.com/2018/10/18/lindsey-graham-needs-police-security-after-kavanaugh-hearings|Lindsey Graham,Judge Jeanine,Trending|2018-10-18|||Sen. Lindsey Graham appeared on &quot;Hannity&quot; Wednesday to react to the incivility he&#39;s seeing from many on the left, and what&#39;s at stake in November&#39;s midterm elections.

Sean Hannity introduced the topic by noting that prominent Democrats like Hillary Clinton, Eric Holder and Maxine Waters have made comments that appeared to encourage their supporters to confront or harass political opponents.

&quot;This is what happens when you can&#39;t win at the ballot box. You take those of us who did win and you try to intimidate us into bending to your will,&quot; Graham (R-S.C.) said.

He revealed that he now has officers with the Capitol Police provide security, something he never had to do until the contentious Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court hearings.

He said that in one instance, a man confronted him on an elevator in the Senate office building and would not let the door close, so he was forced to retreat to his office while the man was escorted out.

“I had a bunch of people around me filming me, yelling at me, saliva all over my jacket. It was pretty bad, and I can only imagine what my other colleagues went through,” Graham said.

He said the notion of civility in politics is on the ballot in the midterms.

&quot;Once the election&#39;s over, do you want those who lost to try to physically assault those who won? Or do you want to have an election [and] once it&#39;s over we try to govern the country?&quot; Graham said.
