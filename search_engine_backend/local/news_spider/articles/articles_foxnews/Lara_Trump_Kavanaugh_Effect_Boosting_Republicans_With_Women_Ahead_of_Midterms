Lara Trump: 'Kavanaugh Effect' Boosting Republicans With Women Ahead of Midterms|http://insider.foxnews.com|http://insider.foxnews.com/2018/10/18/lara-trump-kavanaugh-effect-boosting-republicans-women-ahead-midterms|Judge Jeanine,Lara Trump|2018-10-18|||Lara Trump said Wednesday on &quot;Fox News @ Night&quot; that she believes female support for President Trump and Republican candidates is not accurately reflected in polls.

President Trump&#39;s daughter-in-law, also a top 2020 campaign adviser, told Shannon Bream that it&#39;s &quot;astonishing&quot; to see how many women were turned off by the way Democrats handled the sexual assault allegations against new Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.

&quot;After what I like to call the Kavanaugh effect, the number of women that I think are more inspired on the Republican end now to get out and vote is really astonishing,&quot; she said, arguing that most women do not focus on the president&#39;s tweets, including an insulting one Tuesday toward Stormy Daniels.

“Federal Judge throws out Stormy Danials lawsuit versus Trump. Trump is entitled to full legal fees.” @FoxNews Great, now I can go after Horseface and her 3rd rate lawyer in the Great State of Texas.

“I was in North Carolina yesterday and the number of women that turned out at all the places I went, all the events supporting the president, supporting these midterm candidates, it was pretty amazing,” she stated, claiming female voters are concerned most about security and the economy.

A recent Fox News poll found a wide gender gap, with Democrats up 56 points among non-white women, 35 points with women under age 45 and by 19 points among suburban women. Since 2016, white women have shifted from backing Trump by nine points to backing the Democrat by two points.

At a recent event, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) predicted a blue &quot;tsunami&quot; on November 6, placing Democrats in control of the House.

Mrs. Trump said that would be a &quot;disaster&quot; for the country, since it would lead to the impeachment of the president and the halting of his agenda.

&quot;Everything you&#39;ve seen positive happen under President Donald Trump will come to a screeching halt.&quot;
