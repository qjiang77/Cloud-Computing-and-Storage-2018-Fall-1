Holder told a group that although he respected Obama, he would alter her "when they go low, we go high" line regarding political opponents. His amendment? "When they go low, we kick them.

Ingraham said that, although she and Obama do not agree on many policy platforms, "the first lady is right."

Obama said that parents should not be an example of "angry" or "vengeful" people for their children.

"What do we want to teach our kids in all this?" Ingraham asked, echoing Obama.

Ingraham said she and Obama would both likely not approve of "foul language on [political] signs" and "banging on the Supreme Court" door.

However, Ingraham said that Obama has not made similar remarks in response to fiery rhetoric from Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.).
