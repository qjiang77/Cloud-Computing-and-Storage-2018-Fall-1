She said that the reason America has an &quot;outsider business man&quot; president like Trump is, in fact, because of Obama.

Obama&#39;s speech marked his return to the campaign trail in an effort to rally Democrats ahead of November&#39;s midterm elections.

&quot;The only reason that we have an outsider business man president is because of you,&quot; Pirro said of Obama. &quot;Your lies, your policies, and your divisiveness. ... You, Barack. You elected Donald Trump.&quot;

During his speech Friday, Obama warned that there are &quot;dire&quot; consequences to staying on the political sidelines, adding that &quot;powerful and privileged&quot; people want to &quot;keep us angry.&quot;

He also said that Trump is &quot;capitalizing on resentments that politicians have been fanning for years.&quot;

Pirro said Saturday that Obama ran the most corrupt presidential administration since Harry Truman.

&quot;You can&#39;t stand it that every metric under the Trump administration is better off than when you were in office.&quot;

She said that Obama&#39;s criticism of Trump and the GOP on Friday was all about his ego and his &quot;corrupt deep state power structure.&quot;

&quot;You desperately tried to defeat Trump and it didn&#39;t work,&quot; she said. &quot;Your version of America is not the America we want.&quot;
