Williams on 'West' Wing Mtg: Trump Used Kanye as 'Prop' to 'Tell White Supporters I'm Not Racist'|http://insider.foxnews.com|http://insider.foxnews.com/2018/10/11/kanye-west-white-house-meeting-trump-juan-says-it-was-impress-white-gop-base|Trending,Donald Trump,Kanye West,Judge Jeanine|2018-10-11|||Juan Williams blasted President Trump's Oval Office meeting with musician Kanye West and former Cleveland Browns running back Jim Brown.

Williams said Trump used West, 41, as a "prop" to impress a following said to be largely white.

Kanye West: "If [@POTUS] don't look good, we don't look good. This is our president. He has to be the freshest, the flyest..." @johnrobertsFox reports on West's visit to the @WhiteHouse Wednesday. @ShepNewsTeam https://t.co/wEMXZrJNlI pic.twitter.com/ddduH5m4tq â€” Fox News (@FoxNews) October 11, 2018

"This is Trump speaking to his white backers saying 'I'm not racist'," Williams said. "He's Kanye West, so all these things about [Trump] calling people 'dogs' and saying people 'coming from s**thole countries' [can be overlooked]."

Williams said the Oval Office should be "treated with respect," appearing to nod to the fact that West used an expletive while praising Trump.

"This behavior by Trump didn't start yesterday," he said, pointing out that Brown, 82, had a meeting with the then-president-elect in Trump Tower after the 2016 election.

Jesse Watters disagreed, saying that West brought attention to a key issue in the black community.

West said that much of the nation's inner-city factory jobs have moved to China, and that with Trump's trade standoff with the country, those areas may see economic rejuvenation.

Greg Gutfeld ripped the media at-large for calling the Trump-West summit "bonkers" and appeared to "dog whistle" that the rapper has mental issues.

"Such ridicule by those who would never even think of taking such risk," Gutfeld said.
