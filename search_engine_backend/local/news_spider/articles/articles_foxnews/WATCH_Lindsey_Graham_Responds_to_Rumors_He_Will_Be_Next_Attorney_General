WATCH: Lindsey Graham Responds to Rumors He Will Be Next Attorney General|http://insider.foxnews.com|http://insider.foxnews.com/2018/10/10/lindsey-graham-rumor-he-will-be-attorney-general-haley-takes-senate-seat|Jeff Sessions,Lindsey Graham,Judge Jeanine,Nikki Haley|2018-10-10|||South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham responded to rumors that, with U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley's resignation, she will look to take Graham's seat as he purportedly moves to replace Jeff Sessions as attorney general.

Sessions and President Donald Trump have had an on and off icy relationship since the start of the Russia probe. The former Alabama senator was however one of Trump's earliest endorsers.

"That's crazy," Graham, a Republican, said. "[Haley] did a great job."

Graham said that Haley, a former governor of the Palmetto State, was being honest when she said she wants to spend more time with her family.

"I'll bet you $20 -- 10-to-1 odds," he said. "If I'm attorney general, I'll give you $200 and if not you give me $20."

Graham said he was honored to be considered qualified the job, but said his most effective office for the benefit of South Carolinians is in the U.S. Senate.

He said he will seek reelection in 2020.
