On the heels of the largest budget deficit in six years. President Trump is pushing his Cabinet to find cuts.

FOX&#39;s Jared Halpern has more from Washington:

President Trump is requesting each Cabinet Secretary to cut five percent from their budgets next year:

(President Trump): &quot;And I think if you can do more than that, we will be very happy. There are some people at the table, I won&#39;t point you out, who can do substantially more than that.&quot;

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in a session with reporters says increased spending was part of an agreement to secure more funding for the military.

A Treasury Department report this week showed a higher deficit for the fiscal year that ended last month.

Revenues were up slightly after the tax cuts passed by Congress.
