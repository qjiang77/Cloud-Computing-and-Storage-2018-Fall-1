'The Party of Bait-and-Switch': Comedian Rips Magazine for Phony Story to Promote Voter Registration|http://insider.foxnews.com|http://insider.foxnews.com/2018/10/20/elle-magazine-tweets-phony-story-promote-voter-registration-comedian-michael-loftus|Judge Jeanine,Michael Loftus|2018-10-20|||Comedian Michael Loftus slammed Elle Magazine Saturday on Fox & Friends for tweeting out a false story with a link that redirected people to register to vote.

The account -- with nearly 7 million followers -- wrote in the tweet, &quot;Kim Kardashian and Kanye West are splitting up,&quot; but the link took readers to a Register to Vote page.

The move was met with backlash from both users and journalists alike, accusing the lifestyle magazine of click-baiting them.

You give journalists a bad name. This is horrible. So unethical. — Brittney Hopper (@brittneytv) October 18, 2018

Loftus, who wrote for the CBS series &quot;Kevin Can Wait,&quot; said on Saturday that the Democratic Party has now become &quot;the party of bait-and-switch.&quot;

He said that Democrats are &quot;pulling out all the stops&quot; ahead of November’s midterm elections.

&quot;It&#39;s a classic Democratic scheme,&quot; he said. &quot;It probably cost a lot of money and then came across as a bad idea, and everybody has a bad taste in their mouth. Just like every Democratic policy.&quot;

One Twitter user called the tweet &quot;trash nonsense,&quot; and others condemned the magazine for its feigned headline.

This is trash nonsense. Who do you think you are reaching with this? Guess what? One can be civic minded and interested in celebrity gossip. Do better. — roxane gay (@rgay) October 18, 2018

Loftus added on Saturday that the decision by Elle was a &quot;bad idea.&quot;

&quot;[The magazine] should really stick to fashion advice and horoscopes and dating tips,&quot; he said.

Elle apologized in a follow-up tweet, stating that their &quot;passion for voter registration clouded our judgement.&quot;

We made a bad joke. Our passion for voter registration clouded our judgement and we are sincerely sorry. https://t.co/cYGGrpfBCz — ELLE Magazine (US) (@ELLEmagazine) October 18, 2018
