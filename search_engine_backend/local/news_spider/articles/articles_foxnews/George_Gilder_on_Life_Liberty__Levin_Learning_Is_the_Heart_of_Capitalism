George Gilder on 'Life, Liberty & Levin': 'Learning Is the Heart of Capitalism'|http://insider.foxnews.com|http://insider.foxnews.com/2018/10/14/george-gilder-life-liberty-levin-learning-heart-capitalism|Judge Jeanine,George Gilder|2018-10-14|||This week on Life, Liberty & Levin, Mark Levin spoke with writer and economist George Gilder about the future of the economy and technology.

Levin said that the economic problem with progressivism is that those who believe in it think they know everything they need to.

"The future is unpredictable," Gilder replied. "In order to deal with it successfully you have to learn, and learning has a lot of constraints."

He also paralleled learning and increasing one's knowledge with economic growth.

Gilder also noted the learning curve and how it relates to economics.

"With every doubling of total sales, you get a 20 to 30 percent drop in cost. And this drop in cost is evident across all industries," he said.

He said that learning depends on the openness to creativity.

"Learning is the heart of capitalism," he said. "Learning is finding out things you don't already know."
