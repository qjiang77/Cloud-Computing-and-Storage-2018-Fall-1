'Bad Messages'?: The Five on Hollywood Actresses Banning Daughters from Watching Fairy Tales|http://insider.foxnews.com|http://insider.foxnews.com/2018/10/18/kristen-bell-bans-daughter-snow-white-five-reacts|Judge Jeanine|2018-10-18|||The panel on &quot;The Five&quot; reacted to a pair of Hollywood actresses banning their daughters from viewing some animated fairy tale films.

&quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; star Keira Knightley recently said her daughter is not allowed to watch &quot;Cinderella&quot; because of how it purportedly shows a masculine character saving a woman.

&quot;Veronica Mars&quot; actress Kristen Bell blasted &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; as a film that sends a bad message to young girls, Kennedy reported.

Bell said the prince in the film kissed Snow White without consent.

Jesse Watters said that as the father of twin girls, he sees &quot;room for romance &#39;and&#39; the MeToo movement.&quot;

&quot;Let kids be normal, they&#39;ll figure it out,&quot; he said.

Kennedy said Knightley misconstrued Cinderella&#39;s premise -- adding that it is really an anti-bullying film.

Greg Gutfeld said that too many people are trying to &quot;out-woke&quot; each other, and are thereby undermining the unifying premises of fairy tales.

He joked that Bell&#39;s husband, Dax Shepard, was well known for doing &quot;a lot of things without consent,&quot; including reportedly walking around naked while on the television program &quot;Punk&#39;d.&quot;
