Tucker on Migrant Caravan: Dems 'Inviting' It in Effort to Strengthen Their Hold on Power|http://insider.foxnews.com|http://insider.foxnews.com/2018/10/18/tucker-blasts-honduras-nicaragua-caravan-democrat-inviting-it-because-helps-politics|Judge Jeanine|2018-10-18|||Tucker Carlson said Thursday that Democrats like Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) are not joining President Trump&#39;s calls to stop the caravan of Central American migrants because the left believes that &quot;unchecked immigration will strengthen their hold on power.&quot;

A caravan of impoverished emigrants is making its way north from Guatemala, Nicaragua and Honduras. President Trump warned this week that he will halt federal aid funding to the two nations if they do not act to stop the exodus.

&quot;An entire political party is inviting it,&quot; Carlson said, adding that when Pelosi told an audience it would be &quot;immoral&quot; to build a wall, it is because she believes &quot;unchecked immigration&quot; will help their political future.

Carlson said that, to the left, people who support a wall and rule-of-law immigration policies are largely &quot;bigots&quot; and &quot;moral reprobates.&quot;

He played tape of former McCain campaign adviser Steve Schmidt comparing Trump&#39;s border policy to the Trail of Tears.

&quot;This is a moral outrage,&quot; Schmidt said, invoking &quot;slave auction blocks and separation of Native American families.&quot;

Comedian Rosie O&#39;Donnell, seated next to Schmidt, then professed her &quot;love&quot; for him over the statement.

Carlson said the left hopes to &quot;bully the population into silence,&quot; pointing to CNN host Chris Cuomo saying strict immigration policies are &quot;fear-based.&quot;
