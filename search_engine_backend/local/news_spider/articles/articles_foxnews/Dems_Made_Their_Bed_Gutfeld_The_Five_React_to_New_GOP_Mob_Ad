"I don't even know why there aren't uprising all over this country?" House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi of California said in one clip from the ad.

"You cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for," Hillary Clinton says in another.

New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker is also seen telling a crowd to "get up in the face of some Congresspeople."

"The Democrats made their bed when they marginalized the process," Greg Gutfeld said, adding that Democrats treatment of Justice Brett Kavanaugh has been "an absurd witch trial masked as a job interview.

Gutfeld said that CNN personalities -- including news anchor Brooke Baldwin and others -- have blasted Republicans for using the term mob.

"We just watched them mob [Kanye West]," he said.

Jesse Watters said the GOP ad shows the political divide that people have been pointing out.

He said that many see the left as "Venezuelan" in their politics, and the right as "MAGA" -- in reference to President Trump's political slogan.
