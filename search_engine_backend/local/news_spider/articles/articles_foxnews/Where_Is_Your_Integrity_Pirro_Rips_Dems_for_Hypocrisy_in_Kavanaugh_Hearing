Pirro said the Democrats were willing to succeed and block the judge&#39;s confirmation to the high court at all costs.

&quot;The spectacle I saw this week was one of the most pathetic, disheartening and saddest displays to which this nation has ever stood witness,&quot; she said.

Judge Jeanine called out Sen. Cory Booker (N.J.) for supporting Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey Ford, even though he admitted in a 1992 newspaper column to groping a friend without her consent.

She blasted Sen. Mazie Hirono (HI) for saying that Republicans have tossed out the rules to advance Kavanaugh&#39;s confirmation, yet she declared him guilty of sexual misconduct before hearing either his or Ford&#39;s testimony.

This morning, @SenKamalaHarris and I walked out of the Judiciary Committee markup on Brett Kavanaugh. This Committee and the Republicans have tossed out all rules and norms to push Brett Kavanaugh onto the Supreme Court. We will not be part of this sham. pic.twitter.com/F1coQbXrwd â€” Senator Mazie Hirono (@maziehirono) September 28, 2018

&quot;This is about people desperate to win at all costs [and] take a man and his family down, no problem,&quot; Pirro said. &quot;It&#39;s the battle of the hypocrites.&quot;

Finally, she ripped Sen. Dianne Feinstein (Calif.) for her delay in revealing Ford&#39;s accusations after receiving them in July.

&quot;You had other plans. Your plan was to leak it,&quot; Pirro said. &quot;Where is your integrity? You and everyone in the Senate knows this could have been handled confidentially.&quot;
