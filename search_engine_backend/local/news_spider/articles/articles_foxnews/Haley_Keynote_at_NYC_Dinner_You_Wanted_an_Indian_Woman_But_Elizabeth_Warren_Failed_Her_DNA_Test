Ambassador Nikki Haley brought laughter to the annual Al Smith Dinner in New York City on Thursday when she riffed on Sen. Elizabeth Warren.

Haley was chosen as the keynote speaker for the white-tie dinner that raises money for Catholic charities that support needy children, and is named for the late New York Gov. Alfred E. Smith (D).

Smith was the first major-party Catholic presidential candidate -- who ended up losing his bid to President Herbert Hoover (R) in 1928.

It is traditionally hosted by the Archbishop of New York -- currently His Eminence Timothy Cardinal Dolan.

When Haley took the microphone, she joked that the 2017 dinner was hosted by &quot;boy scout&quot; Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), suggesting that he was an admirable but unexciting choice.

&quot;You wanted to spice things up again -- you wanted an Indian woman, but Elizabeth Warren failed her DNA test,&quot; Haley riffed.

Haley&#39;s parents, Ajit and Raj Randhawa, immigrated from Punjab, India in 1969.

Warren has repeatedly claimed to be of Cherokee descent, a topic that President Trump has made light of at campaign rallies.

Upon releasing her DNA test results, it was determined that Warren holds between 1/64 and 1/1,024 Native American blood.

&quot;She was a star,&quot; Ed Rollins, President Reagan&#39;s 1984 campaign manager, said of Haley on &quot;America&#39;s Newsroom.&quot;

Rollins said that when Haley formally leaves the U.N., she will not disappear from the political scene.
