Ronald Derisi, of Smithtown, Long Island, allegedly left numerous disturbing voicemails for Sens. Chuck Grassley (Iowa) and Susan Collins (Maine).

Derisi, 74, reportedly made the calls in an attempt to get the senators to pull their support for Kavanaugh ahead of his confirmation to the high court.

He allegedly left a message on Grassley&#39;s office phone late last month saying he had a &quot;present&quot; for him, &quot;a 9-millimeter. Side of your f***ing skull you scumbag motherf***er.&quot;

Derisi allegedly left a message for Collins saying, &quot;You better pray [Kavanaugh] don’t get in&quot; and then another saying, &quot;Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock.&quot;

He is accused of also telling Collins, &quot;I’m gonna get you.&quot;

News 12 Long Island reported that Derisi&#39;s defense attorney said he has severe cerebral atrophy -- shrinking of the brain -- and takes medication for it.

The news outlet also reported that the elderly man was to be kept in custody and undergo a psychological evaluation.
