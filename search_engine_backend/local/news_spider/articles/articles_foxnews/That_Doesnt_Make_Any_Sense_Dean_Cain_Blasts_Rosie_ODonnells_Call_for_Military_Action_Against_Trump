'That Doesn't Make Any Sense': Dean Cain Blasts Rosie O'Donnell's Call for Military Action Against Trump|http://insider.foxnews.com|http://insider.foxnews.com/2018/10/20/rosie-odonnell-calls-military-remove-trump-white-house-dean-cain-reacts|Judge Jeanine,Rosie O'Donnell,Dean Cain|2018-10-20|||Actor Dean Cain slammed longtime Trump critic Rosie O&#39;Donnell on Friday for suggesting the United States military remove the president from the White House.

O&#39;Donnell made the remark Thursday on MSNBC, during a segment where Trump&#39;s threat to have the military close southern border was discussed.

The president tweeted that he will &quot;call up the U.S. Military&quot; if Mexican officials don&#39;t stop the northern progress of a migrant caravan.

....In addition to stopping all payments to these countries, which seem to have almost no control over their population, I must, in the strongest of terms, ask Mexico to stop this onslaught - and if unable to do so I will call up the U.S. Military and CLOSE OUR SOUTHERN BORDER!.. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 18, 2018

&quot;I want to send the military to the White House to get him,&quot; O&#39;Donnell said.

Cain said on Tucker Carlson Tonight that O&#39;Donnell&#39;s comments were a &quot;thinly veiled&quot; joke but that, like her call to impose martial law in order to delay Trump&#39;s inauguration last January, it was &quot;insane.&quot;

&quot;Even on [MSNBC], all they did was laugh. ... Why didn&#39;t anybody offer a dissenting opinion and say, &#39;That doesn&#39;t make any sense?&#39;&quot; he said.

O&#39;Donnell added on Thursday that she &quot;took a year out of the spotlight&quot; after Trump was elected to compose herself.

&quot;I took a year out of the spotlight&quot;
