'We're All in This Together': Veteran Climbs Mt. Kilimanjaro on Prosthetic Legs|http://insider.foxnews.com|http://insider.foxnews.com/2018/10/13/veteran-adam-keys-climbs-mt-kilimanjaro-prosthetic-legs|Army,Trending,Judge Jeanine|2018-10-13|||A wounded Army paratrooper missing three limbs appeared on Fox & Friends on Saturday to share his inspiring story about climbing Mount Kilimanjaro.

After being injured by a roadside bomb in 2010, Adam Keys made it through more than 100 surgeries and competed in marathons.

He said on Saturday that, after receiving new prosthetic legs, he decided to train for the 19,000-foot trek.

Keys, a Purple Heart recipient, left his medal at the summit of the volcano to recognize servicemen and women around the world.

"We're all in this together and we always have been," he said. "It was my Purple Heart but I left it at the top for all of us."

He added that the journey took him six days and that he trained for six months to prepare his body.

"Most people said [the train] for a year, year and a half," he said.

"My driving force was the five guys [who] didn't make it home," he said, referring to the members of his platoon who died in the blast.

Keys' next big test is to run in the New York City Marathon on November 4.
