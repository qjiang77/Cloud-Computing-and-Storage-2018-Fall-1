Whether it&#39;s starring in ads for The Boring Party, teaching a cable news masterclass, watching Trump opponents scream helplessly at the sky, or speaking entirely in Gen. James Mattis quotes, she&#39;s always coming up with something to keep us laughing.

Read on for 5 Things You Didn&#39;t Know about Kat...

1. I want a tegu. In case you’re a little less strange than I am, a tegu is a big lizard. I want one really bad.

I want to name him Pierogi Pierogi Timpf and walk him on a leash. This is what I think about while people my age are planning weddings and having children.

2. I’m a huge Detroit Red Wings fan. I was raised in the Detroit area, and I’m a huge hockey fan.

In fact, I’m the only Timpf kid to never play. I did, however, once cry in a Mexican restaurant after the Wings lost to the San Jose Sharks and got knocked out of the playoffs.

3. I have a cat named Cheens. When I was 21 years old, I rescued a cat from the streets of North Hollywood. He’s very shy, and runs from pretty much everyone except for me.

He snuggles me. I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t into it.

4. I used to be an airborne traffic reporter in Los Angeles. I was laid off after six months, which makes total sense, since I am terrible with directions.

5. I sometimes do stand-up comedy. Before I started working at Fox News, I used to perform stand-up comedy almost every night. I’ve performed at clubs and venues all around the country.

I still do it sometimes, and it’s one of the most fun and also nerve-racking things that I could possibly imagine.

Stay up-to-date with Kat on Twitter (her tweets are hilarious) and Instagram and don&#39;t miss her on The Greg Gutfeld Show every Saturday night at 10pm ET!
