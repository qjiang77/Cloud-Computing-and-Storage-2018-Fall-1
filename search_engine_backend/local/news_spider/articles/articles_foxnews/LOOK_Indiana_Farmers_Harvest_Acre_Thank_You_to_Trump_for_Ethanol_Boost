The president made the announcement earlier this month at a rally in Council Bluffs, Iowa.

Bruce Buchanan, of Buchanan Family Farms, said Sunday on Fox & Friends that he and his fellow farmers wanted to express their gratitude to Trump in an &quot;unusual way.&quot;

The result was a monstrous corn maze message that reads &quot;Thanks Mr Trump For E15.&quot;

Buchanan called the experience of creating the thank you to the president &quot;incredible.&quot;

&quot;We literally mechanically harvested the corn as we proceeded to spell out the letters in the maze,&quot; he said.

He added that Trump has &quot;certainly&quot; delivered on his promises to the farming community.

&quot;The future is very instrumental on people like President Trump,&quot; he said.
