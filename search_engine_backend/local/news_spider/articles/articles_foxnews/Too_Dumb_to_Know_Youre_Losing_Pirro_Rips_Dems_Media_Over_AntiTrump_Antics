'Too Dumb to Know You're Losing': Pirro Rips Dems, Media Over Anti-Trump 'Antics'|http://insider.foxnews.com|http://insider.foxnews.com/2018/10/14/judge-jeanine-pirro-rips-democrats-media-over-anti-trump-antics|Judge Jeanine,Brett Kavanaugh,Judge Jeanine Opening Statement,Hillary Clinton,Trending,Eric Holder,Donald Trump|2018-10-14|||In her Opening Statement on Saturday, Judge Jeanine Pirro said that the anti-Trump tactics of the left are backfiring.

She said that Americans are buying into Trump&#39;s success, and not the &quot;politically correct losing behavior&quot; of presidents before him.

&quot;American momentum is now around winning, the winning that outsider candidate Donald Trump promised us,&quot; she said.

“American momentum is now around winning. The winning that outsider President @realDonaldTrump promised us. Not the anarchy Democrats—aka demon rats—want to impose on us .”

Pirro noted the &quot;insanity&quot; from the left during the Kavanaugh hearings, like confronting senators and clawing on the doors of the U.S. Supreme Court.

&quot;Americans are fair and they&#39;ve had enough.&quot;

Judge Jeanine also reacted to comments by Hillary Clinton and former Attorney General Eric Holder that apparently called for incivility toward Republicans.

During an interview last week, Clinton said that the time to be civil is when Democrats take back the House, Senate or both.

&quot;You cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for, what you care about,&quot; the former secretary of state said.

Holder told a crowd last Sunday that he respects Michelle Obama, but thinks her phrase &quot;when they go low, we go high&quot; should be &quot;when they go low, we kick them.&quot;

&quot;To all those Trump-hating &#39;demon rats&#39; and the mainstream media, keep up the antics,&quot; Pirro said. &quot;You&#39;re all losers. Sore losers. Stupid losers. Too dumb to even know that you&#39;re losing.&quot;
