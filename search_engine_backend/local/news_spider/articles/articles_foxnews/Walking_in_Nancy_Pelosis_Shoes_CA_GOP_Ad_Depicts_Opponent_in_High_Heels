'Walking in Nancy Pelosi's Shoes': CA GOP Ad Depicts Opponent in High Heels|http://www.foxnews.com|http://insider.foxnews.com/2018/10/21/elizabeth-heng-political-ad-depicts-opponent-nancy-pelosis-shoes|Judge Jeanine,Jim Costa,Elizabeth Heng|2018-10-21|||A Republican congressional candidate in California took a humorous approach to compare her opponent to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).

The latest ad for Elizabeth Heng depicts Jim Costa (D) in red high heels, or &quot;Nancy Pelosi&#39;s shoes,&quot; struggling to walk down the street.

Heng said Sunday on Fox & Friends that the &quot;lighthearted&quot; ad was meant to show how Costa supports Pelosi&#39;s policies like sanctuary cities and gun control.

&quot;We&#39;re really excited about the message it sends,&quot; she said.

&quot;Votes against the farm bill, but supports sanctuary cities, higher taxes, more spending, gun control and a money-wasting bullet train. Allows San Francisco environmentalists to deny us our water. Nancy Pelosi? Yep, but also, surprisingly, Jim Costa,&quot; the ad&#39;s narration says.

Costa told The Fresno Bee in a statement that he has &quot;long believed the Democratic Party needs new leadership.&quot;

Heng told Ed Henry that Costa has been &quot;too busy&quot; attacking her and hasn&#39;t focused on key issues in Californiaâ€™s 16th congressional district, like access to water.

As Fox News reported, &quot;at least 46 Democratic candidates have said they would not vote for [Pelosi] for House speaker if the party gains the majority.&quot;
