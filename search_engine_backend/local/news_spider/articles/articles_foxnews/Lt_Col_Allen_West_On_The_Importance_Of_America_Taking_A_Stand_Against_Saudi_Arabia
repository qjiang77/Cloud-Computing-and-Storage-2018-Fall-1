Lt.Col. Allen West (Ret) spoke with Brian Kilmeade about why it is necessary for the United States to take an important stance against Saudi Arabia by letting them know we cannot do business with them as long as the Crown Prince is the heir apparent because of his ruthless behavior and the death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Lt. Col. West also discussed how the left is trying to nationalize the Texas Senate race between Senator Ted Cruz and Congressman Beto O&#39;Rouke and how it all ties into his new book &quot;Hold Texas, Hold the Nation: Victory or Death&quot;.
