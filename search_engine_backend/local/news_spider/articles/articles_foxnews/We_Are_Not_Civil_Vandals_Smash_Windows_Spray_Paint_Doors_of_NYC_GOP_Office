The Metropolitan Republican Club's windows were smashed, its locks were broken and its doors were spray painted with anarchy symbols.

A note left behind at the building read that the attack was putting the Republican Party "on notice."

"Our attack is merely a beginning. We are not passive, we are not civil, and we will not apologize," it stated.

Thursday's incident followed a similar message by Hillary Clinton on Tuesday, when she said Democrats can't be "civil" with Republicans during Donald Trump's presidency.

Protesters in Portland, Oregon, also shouted profanities at drivers and smashed a car's windows last weekend in response to the fatal police shooting of Patrick K. Kimmons.

Clinton said on Tuesday that the time to be civil is when Democrats take back the House, Senate or both.

The Metropolitan Republican Club tweeted out a series of messages on Friday, saying it "will continue to fight for freedom of speech and liberty."

But rest assured that we will not be intimidated by violence, threats, or hate speech. We will continue to fight for freedom of speech and liberty here in New York City and all across this great nation. #NYC #nycvotes #Election2018 #gop #Republican #RepublicanParty — Metropolitan Republican Club (@metgopclub) October 12, 2018

The vandals' note also mentioned that the club invited a "hipster fascist clown" to speak there, reportedly referring to Vice Media co-founder Gavin McInnes.
