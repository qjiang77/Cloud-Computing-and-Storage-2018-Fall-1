How a parent reacts when a child says they&#39;re being bullied can make a big difference.

FOX&#39;s Lisa Brady has part two of National Bullying Prevention Month in this week&#39;s Fox on Family:

What should you say, if your child tells you they&#39;re being bullied:

(Hertzog): &quot;They may not use the word bullying, but maybe they say hey somebody&#39;s really bothering me at school. And I think our gut instinct as parents is to say, just ignore it.&quot;

But Julie Hertzog, head of the bullying prevention center at non-profit Pacer, says it takes a lot of courage for kids to speak up; many aren&#39;t telling their parents. So she recommends thanking them and letting them talk:

(Hertzog): &quot;Giving that support to your child and saying I&#39;m so glad that you&#39;re telling me about this-stress that, and that way you&#39;re encouraging the conversation around it.&quot;

Then, have them help you come up with options; what they want to change and who to talk to, to help make it happen:

(Hertzog): &quot;For kids it&#39;s not always even about fixing it right away. It&#39;s about giving them some of that power back that they&#39;ve lost by being bullied.&quot;

Restoring some confidence and self-esteem, and reaffirming they&#39;re being taken seriously, with an action plan that also helps if it happens again.

PACER is a nonprofit center that helps families of children with disabilities from birth through age 21. The group&#39;s National Bullying Prevention Center started a prevention week in 2006 and it was expanded to bullying prevention month in 2010. Much more information about bullying awareness and prevention is available at pacer.org/bullying, including interactive resources, information for children and teens and an online module for parents. That includes conversations to have from a young age, how to help and protect your child and an outline of laws in each state designed to help protect children.
