Check Out the 'Fox News Favorite Faces' Costume Collection on 'The Greg Gutfeld Show'|http://insider.foxnews.com|http://insider.foxnews.com/2018/10/14/greg-gutfeld-show-fox-news-favorite-faces-halloween-costume-collection|Donald Trump,Judge Jeanine|2018-10-14|||The crew on Saturday's Greg Gutfeld Show aired a video ad for a new collection of costumes inspired by some of Fox News' most popular personalities.

The ad comes after a city in Virginia threatened to fine or even jail trick-or-treaters over the age of 12 to make Halloween safer.

Each costume in the "Fox News Favorite Faces" collection is fair and balanced, and can help you dress up as top newsers like Brian Kilmeade, Steve Doocy and Tucker Carlson.

Each outfit includes a dark jacket, light shirt and a bold but tasteful tie!

Watch the hilarious ad below, and don't miss the off-the-wall laughs on The Greg Gutfeld Show, Saturday nights at 10:00pm ET on Fox News Channel.
