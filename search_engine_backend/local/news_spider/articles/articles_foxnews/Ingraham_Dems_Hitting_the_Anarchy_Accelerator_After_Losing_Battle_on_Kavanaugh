Ingraham: Dems Hitting the 'Anarchy Accelerator' After Losing Battle on Kavanaugh|http://insider.foxnews.com|http://insider.foxnews.com/2018/10/10/laura-ingraham-democrats-resorting-anarchy-after-kavanaugh-scotus-appointment|Donald Trump,Hillary Clinton,Brett Kavanaugh,Judge Jeanine|2018-10-10|||Laura Ingraham said Tuesday that Democrats are now banking on chaos after the appointment of Justice Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.

She noted the harassment of Republicans and Trump officials, protests against Kavanaugh and Hillary Clinton's apparent acceptance of incivility against the GOP.

"They're hitting the anarchy accelerator. These people truly believe they can protest their way back into power," Ingraham said.

She said that Democrats are invoking a "thuggish, win-at-all-costs approach," describing them as the "agents of mayhem."

During an interview on Tuesday, Clinton said that Democrats can be civil toward Republicans when they take back the House, Senate or both.

"You cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for, what you care about," the former secretary of state said.

Clinton would rather see the country thrown into chaos, Ingraham said, than admit Trump's policies are succeeding.

"This is all about foisting a liberal construct on America," she said.

Democrats are actually resentful that the country is prospering, Ingraham added, and they're displaying Antifa-like resistance.

"The Democrats have decided to run on just a platform of demonization."
