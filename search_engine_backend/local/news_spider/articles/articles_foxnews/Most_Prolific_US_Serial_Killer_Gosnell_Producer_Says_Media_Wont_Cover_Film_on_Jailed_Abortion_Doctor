The film, which features &quot;What&#39;s Happening&quot; star Earl Billings as the namesake abortion doctor and &quot;Superman&quot; Dean Cain as a Philly detective, opened this weekend to few formal reviews but an unexpectedly high attendance, Martha MacCallum reported.

Gosnell, who ran the infamous clinic at 3801 Lancaster Ave. in the Powelton Village section of West Philadelphia for decades, was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison.

McAleer said that over 30 years, Gosnell caused the deaths of viable children and some patients at his office near University City.

&quot;Pro-abortion activists want this story to go away, and reporters won&#39;t cover it,&quot; he said.

&quot;He is without a doubt, America&#39;s most prolific serial killer,&quot; McAleer said.

He said the film &quot;raises a lot of questions&quot; about the practice of abortion, and ripped the mainstream media for largely ignoring its release.

&quot;They don&#39;t want to write anything negative about abortion,&quot; McAleer said.
