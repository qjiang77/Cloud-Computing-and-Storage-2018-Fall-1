Limbaugh to Hannity: I Don't Trust Polls, GOP Will Hold House, Increase Senate Majority|http://insider.foxnews.com|http://insider.foxnews.com/2018/10/17/rush-limbaugh-if-democrats-take-house-they-will-work-force-president-trump-out|Rush Limbaugh,Judge Jeanine,2018 Elections,Donald Trump,Democrats|2018-10-17|||Conservative radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh told Sean Hannity that he does not trust mainstream polls and believes the Republicans will be victorious in the midterm elections.

In an interview set to air Thursday night on Fox News Channel, Limbaugh predicted the GOP will keep control of the House and increase its Senate majority.

&quot;That&#39;s justice. The Democrat Party deserves to lose in the single biggest landslide defeat in my lifetime just for the actions they&#39;ve taken in the last month,&quot; he said, referring to the allegations leveled against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.

On his show Tuesday, Limbaugh said that a Democrat-led House would use every committee to investigate and subpoena Trump administration officials and create gridlock.

&quot;That’s all the Congress is gonna be doing is investigating and indicting. That’s all they’re gonna be doing. That’s all that’s gonna happen,&quot; said Limbaugh, who will appear with Sean Hannity for a full hour Thursday night on Fox News Channel.

He said the &quot;Trump coalition&quot; from the 2016 election -- which included independents and Democrats -- must realize the importance of the midterm elections if they want President Trump to continue advancing his agenda.

He explained that the Democrats&#39; objective is obvious: &quot;force Trump out of Washington, D.C. as soon as they can.&quot;

&quot;They don’t want to wait for a re-election campaign in 2020,&quot; Limbaugh said. &quot;They’re gonna do everything they can to make sure that the Trump administration essentially ceases to exist in January of 2019, if they win the House.&quot;
