Kissinger, 95, was invited to the university&#39;s Stern School of Business on Tuesday, which was the 45th anniversary of when he received his Nobel Peace Prize.

According to the Washington Square News, NYU&#39;s school newspaper, close to 100 people gathered to protest Kissinger.

He was called a &quot;war criminal&quot; by one protester and then told to &quot;rot in hell&quot; by another during the invite-only event.

Kissinger&#39;s 1973 Nobel Prize has been criticized due to his alleged involvement in the 1969 bombings in Cambodia as part of the Vietnam War.

Fox News contributor Raymond Arroyo -- an alumnus of NYU -- said Friday on “The Ingraham Angle” that even former Republican officials aren&#39;t immune to harassment.

&quot;This went on and on. He barely got through the evening,&quot; Arroyo said.

Campus Reform reported that although the event ultimately went forward as planned, those who interrupted and shouted in protest were removed from the room.
