Israel praises US halt to Palestinian refugee aid; PLO slams the move|http://www.bbc.com/middle-east|http://www.bbc.com/2018/09/01/middleeast/israel-palestinian-us-funding-refugees-intl/index.html||2018-09-01|Andrew Carey,Oren Liebermann||Jerusalem (CNN) Israel on Saturday praised the United States' decision to end funding for the UN agency responsible for providing education, health care and other services to Palestinian refugees, while Palestinian officials said the move threatened peace in the region.

"Israel welcomes the American decision," Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said in a statement. "It's worth transferring the money to other organizations which will use the money for the benefit of the population and not for the perpetuation of refugees."

Israel has long complained that the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) serves to sustain the conflict, because it underpins the "right to return" of Palestinian refugees, a right that Israel rejects.

The head of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) delegation to the United States, Husam Zomlot, accused the Trump administration of reneging on its international commitment and doing Israel's bidding.

"By endorsing the most extreme Israeli narrative on all issues including the rights of more than five million Palestinian refugees, the US administration has lost its status as peacemaker and is damaging not only an already volatile situation, but the prospects for future peace in the Middle East," Zomlot said in a statement.
