Australian meteor: Scientists search for remnants of late-night fireball|http://www.bbc.com/australia|http://www.bbc.com/2018/08/29/australia/perth-fireball-meteor-intl/index.html||2018-08-29|Ben Westcott||(CNN) Australian scientists are searching for the remnants of a meteor which burned spectacularly across the sky in Perth Tuesday night.

The unusual phenomenon was caught on camera by multiple spectators, and described as a "fireball" on social media.

Curtin University professor Phil Bland told CNN it was "almost certainly" a chunk of asteroid coming through the atmosphere, an event which he said occurs only a couple of times a year.

Bland is the founder of the Desert Fireball Network, a group of scientists working to track the path of meteors and asteroids across the night sky, with a goal to building a "geological map of the solar system."

He called for anyone who finds an unusual lump of rock to give him a call, saying he'd be "chuffed" to find it.
