Heidi Klum and Tim Gunn are ditching 'Project Runway' for Amazon|http://www.bbc.com/entertainment|http://www.bbc.com/2018/09/07/entertainment/heidi-klum-tim-gunn-leaving-project-runway-amazon/index.html||2018-09-07|Sandra Gonzalez||(CNN) Heidi Klum and Tim Gunn are saying "Auf Wiedersehen" to the series that made them household names so they can create a new show with Amazon.

The streaming platform did not unveil many details about Klum and Gunn's new project in the official announcement Friday, but said the reality series will make use of Amazon's retail DNA for a "shoppable" experience.

In their roles as judge and mentor, respectively, Klum and Gunn saw "Project Runway" through 16 seasons, a network change and saw the franchise birth multiple spin-offs, including one anchored by Gunn called "Project Runway: Under the Gunn."

"Project Runway" debuted on Bravo in 2004 and made a switch to Lifetime in 2009. The series was set to make its return to its original network next year.

"I am incredibly proud of the show, and it will always have a special place in my heart," Klum, who along with Gunn won an Emmy in 2013 for their work on the series. "I am so appreciative of the dedicated fans, and most of all, I am grateful that we could shine a light on creativity and help launch so many talented designers' careers."
