Cynthia Nixon makes final pitch in effort to take down Andrew Cuomo ahead of New York governor primary|http://www.bbc.com/election|http://www.bbc.com/2018/09/08/politics/cynthia-nixon-new-york-governor-primary-closing-argument/index.html||2018-09-08|Gregory Krieg||(CNN) New York Gov.

In an interview Saturday morning, Nixon argued that corruption in Albany, the state capital, can only be cleaned up, and the struggles of working-class New Yorkers properly addressed, by someone from outside the halls of power â€” someone like her.

"We need more people who are public school kids, who are public school parents who ride the subway every day and who know what it's like to be preyed upon by landlords, as my mother and I were when I was a kid," Nixon said. "We need more people elected to office who have a firsthand experience of that."
