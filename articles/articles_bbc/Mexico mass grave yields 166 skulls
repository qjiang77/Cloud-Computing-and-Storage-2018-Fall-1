Mexico mass grave yields 166 skulls|http://www.bbc.com/world|http://www.bbc.com/2018/09/06/americas/mexico-mass-grave-veracruz/index.html||2018-09-06|Elizabeth Plaza||(CNN) Mexican investigators used drones and ground-penetrating radar to search an area in the coastal Veracruz state that has yielded the skulls of at least 166 people, officials said Thursday.

Veracruz Attorney General Jorge Winckler Ortiz said the mass grave was found after a tip came in last month.

The search yielded 200 pieces of clothing, 144 IDs and personal belongings. Evidence indicated the deaths may have occurred a couple of years ago, he said in a statement.

Authorities would not provide details on what may have occurred or where the site is located, given an ongoing investigation.

Veracruz, along with Nuevo León, Guerrero, Jalisco and Michoacán, are among the states where significant amounts of human remains have been discovered in mass graves.
