Waste-to-energy plant to take on Ethiopia's rubbish epidemic|http://www.bbc.com/africa|http://www.bbc.com/2018/08/21/africa/reppie-waste-to-energy-addis-ababa/index.html||2018-08-21|Katy Scott||(CNN) A landslide of rubbish from a vast open-air landfill site just outside of Ethiopia's capital, Addis Ababa, killed more than 110 people last year.

This weekend, the Ethiopian government inaugurated a $120 million waste-to-energy plant, right next to the garbage dump, in an attempt to curb the city's mounting waste problem.

The plant -- called Reppie -- is now operational and able to harvest energy from 1.4 million kilograms of waste each day.

This will produce enough electricity to power an estimated 30% of Addis Ababa's households, according to the company responsible for the project, Cambridge Industries

"One of the exciting things for us about the Reppie facility in Addis is that it's the first of its kind in Africa," Samuel Alemayehu, Managing Director for Africa of Cambridge Industries, tells CNN.
