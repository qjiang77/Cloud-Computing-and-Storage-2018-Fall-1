At least 10 people have died since Typhoon Jebi slammed into western Japan Tuesday, bringing strong winds and lashing rain.

Seven of those killed were in Osaka Prefecture and the others in Mie, Aichi and Shiga, where police said a man in Higashiomi City died after the warehouse he was working in collapsed.

High waves hit breakwaters at a port in Aki, Kochi prefecture, in western Japan.

Typhoon Jebi landed with "very strong" force in Tokushima prefecture Tuesday afternoon, the strongest typhoon to hit the country's mainland since 1993, said Akihiro Kikuchi, from Japan's Meteorological Agency.

Winds lashed buildings and whipped up the sea, yanking an 89-meter-long tanker, the Houunmaru, from its anchorage and ramming it into the bridge connecting Kansai Airport with the mainland.
