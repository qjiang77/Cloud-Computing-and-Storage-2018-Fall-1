Chinese man deported from Kenya over racist remarks|http://www.bbc.com/world|http://www.bbc.com/2018/09/06/africa/kenya-deports-chinese-racist-remarks/index.html||2018-09-06|Bukola Adebayo||Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) A Chinese man caught on video making racist remarks about Kenyans has been deported from the country, Kenya's immigration department said Thursday.

In the video , which circulated widely on social media, the man identified by officials as Liu Jiaqi was heard calling Kenyans "monkeys."

He also insulted Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta in the three-minute video -- among other derogatory comments that have caused furious reactions in the East African country.

Liu said he disliked Kenya because it "smells bad and (its people are) poor, foolish and black."

Authorities said Liu's work permit was revoked after his arrest and he was deported on "racism grounds," the immigration department posted to its official Twitter account.
