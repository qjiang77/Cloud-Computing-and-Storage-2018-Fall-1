Trump mocks light sentence for George Papadopoulos|http://www.bbc.com/us|http://www.bbc.com/2018/09/07/politics/trump-papadopoulos-sentence/index.html||2018-09-07|Jeff Zeleny||Watch Jake Tapper's exclusive interview with the ex-Trump campaign aide in CNN Special Report "The Mysterious Case of George Papadopoulos" Saturday at 8 p.m., ET.

Papadopoulos, who was sentenced to 14 days in jail, is the first Trump adviser to be sentenced as part of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and potential collusion between the Kremlin and the campaign.
