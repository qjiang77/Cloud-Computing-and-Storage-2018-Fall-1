Another hurricane is barreling toward Hawaii|http://www.bbc.com/us|http://www.bbc.com/2018/09/07/us/hurricane-olivia-forecast-hawaii-wxc/index.html||2018-09-07|Allison Chinchar,Haley Brink||(CNN) Hurricane Olivia, a storm with sustained winds of 85 mph, is churning toward Hawaii and could affect the island chain as early as Tuesday evening.

Hurricane Olivia is seen Friday via satellite in the Pacific moving toward Hawaii.

"Although it is too early to pinpoint any details with regard to specifics related to potential impacts to the islands, forecast confidence is increasing each day as the guidance remains in very good agreement," the National Weather Service in Honolulu said.

This forecast prediction, from Friday, shows Hurricane Olivia reaching Hawaii early Wednesday.

Olivia would be the second tropical system to hit the Hawaiian Islands this year. Hurricane Lane dropped more than 50 inches of rain across the Big Island last month.

The storm was the second-wettest tropical system to affect the United States and the wettest tropical system on record in Hawaii, surpassing Hurricane Hiki in 1950.
