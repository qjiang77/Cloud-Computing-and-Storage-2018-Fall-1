Self-harm affects nearly a quarter of UK girls -- report|http://www.bbc.com/uk|http://www.bbc.com/2018/08/29/health/uk-children-self-harm-report-intl/index.html||2018-08-29|Laura Smith-Spark||London (CNN) Nearly a quarter of 14-year-old girls in the United Kingdom have self-harmed, with many facing overwhelming pressures over how they should look, their sexuality and how they behave, according to a new report by The Children's Society.

It found that 22% of 14-year-old girls had self-harmed in the course of a year, compared with 9% of boys.

However, boys and girls who were attracted to teenagers of the same gender or both genders were much more likely to harm themselves, the survey found, with almost half -- 46% -- reporting that they had done so in the past year.

Children from low-income households were also found to have a higher than average risk of self-harming, the report said.

The figures, based on data from 11,000 children collected in the Millennium Cohort Survey for 2015, are included in the charity's annual Good Childhood Report 2018, which looks at the state of children's well-being in the UK.
