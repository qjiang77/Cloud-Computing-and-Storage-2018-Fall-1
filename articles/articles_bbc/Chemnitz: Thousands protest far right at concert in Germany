Chemnitz: Thousands protest far right at concert in Germany|http://www.bbc.com/europe|http://www.bbc.com/2018/09/03/europe/chemnitz-germany-anti-racism-concert-intl/index.html||2018-09-03|Judith Vonberg||(CNN) Tens of thousands attended an anti-racism concert Monday in Germany's eastern city of Chemnitz, following a week of far-right and anti-fascist protests triggered by the fatal stabbing of a German-Cuban man.

City officials said the "#wirsindmehr" concert, which translates to "there are more of us," drew about 65,000 attendees. It featured some of Germany's most well-known musicians, including the punk band Die Toten Hosen.

"Thousands of people have been moving through the streets of Chemnitz, exploiting a senseless death for their own purposes and hunting people because of their origin or the color of their skin," the organizers wrote in a description of the event. "Racism should not be left uncontested on the street."

The concert, which organizers say is not a "festival or a party" but a chance to "show solidarity with all those who have been attacked by neo-Nazis," was to begin with a one-minute moment of silence in memory of Daniel H., the stabbing victim.

Images showed a large crowd at the concert, with some people waving rainbow flags saying "Peace" and "Love," and several with signs carrying anti-Nazi messages, such as, "No place for Nazis" and "Nazis, you shall not pass."
