Upon learning that Cassper trademarked the term #FillUp , Twitter went into a frenzy with a stream of scathing Tweets.

Even Julius Malema and the EFF got involved, and came to Benny Mayengani’s defense.

We will defend you chief @BennyMayengani, don’t be scared of bullies who are threatened by talent. We have the best in town, let them bring it on. #FillUpGiyaniStadium — Julius Sello Malema (@Julius_S_Malema) September 6, 2018

EFF CONDEMNS THE MOVE BY HIP HOP ARTIST CASSPER NYOVEST TO SUE TSONGA ARTISTS BENNY MAYENGANI FOR USING THE WORDS “FILL UP” FOR HIS CONCERT pic.twitter.com/iqQcFumQ2O — Economic Freedom Fighters (@EFFSouthAfrica) September 6, 2018



Cassper Nyovest’s manager clapped back at the EFF with the following statement on Twitter:

You take a stance for your homeboy when you know well & clear what he’s doing is 100% wrong is not only opportunistic but embarrassing. I have so much respect for you, this is actually disgusting, we are NOT politicians! You are sacrificing the hard work of another Black Kid!! https://t.co/GHf0cm27sA — December 1st..

Moments later Cassper shut down the negative comments by explaining that he was doing what any other business owner would do.

Protect your ideas. It’s expensive but it’s worth it. Get your paper work right. TREAT IT LIKE A BUSINESS BECAUSE IT IS A BUSINESS!!! IT’S THE MUSIC BUSINESS!!! — R.M Phoolo (@CassperNyovest) September 6, 2018

A lot of artists die broke because of the issue of ownership, they are mocked by fans& media yet when we educate ourselves, own our talent& ideas we’re attacked. I hope you’re learning through me. We’re about to #FillUpMosesMabhida on the 1st of December. Tickets at Computicket!! — R.M Phoolo (@CassperNyovest) September 6, 2018

Good for you Cassper. But, please give us a moment while we try and figure out how we’re going to communicate that we want to #FillUp our ‘tea’ cups.
