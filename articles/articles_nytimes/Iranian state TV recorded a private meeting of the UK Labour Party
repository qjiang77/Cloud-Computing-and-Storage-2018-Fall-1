Iranian state TV recorded a private meeting of the UK Labour Party|http://nytimes.com/europe|http://nytimes.com/2018/09/07/uk/iranian-press-tv-labour-party-uk-intl/index.html||2018-09-07|Hadas Gold||London (CNN) The UK's opposition Labour Party, embroiled in a months-long battle over accusations of anti-Semitism within its ranks, is facing questions over how one of its members was apparently able to report for an Iranian state TV channel from a meeting where a pro-Israel lawmaker lost a confidence vote.

The UK arm of Press TV posted images and footage to social media from a private meeting of the Enfield North constituency Labour party (CLP) in north London on Thursday night, where members passed a motion of no-confidence in Joan Ryan by 94 votes to 92. Ryan, who was first elected to the UK parliament in 1997, is chair of the Labour Friends of Israel parliamentary caucus.

According to Labour party rules, the media are not allowed to report from constituency meetings and members are not supposed to broadcast or film them.

The chairman of the local Labour branch called on the national party to step in. "This is totally unacceptable. In my capacity as Chair, I'll be writing to formally complain to Press TV for their broadcasting of our meeting," Siddo Dwyer, chair of Enfield North Labour said on Twitter. "The national Labour Party has been informed about filming by Iranian state TV of our CLP meeting. An investigation will take place and a formal complaint lodged."

A spokesman for the UK Labour Party said the issue was a matter for its local branch. "Filming of local Labour Party meetings is not permitted, and Enfield North will be reminded of this fact."
