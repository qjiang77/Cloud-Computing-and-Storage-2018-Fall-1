British warship sails near Chinese-controlled islands in South China Sea|http://nytimes.com/europe|http://nytimes.com/2018/09/06/uk/british-navy-south-china-sea-intl/index.html||2018-09-06|Ben Westcott||(CNN) China has called on the United Kingdom to stop "provocative actions" in the South China Sea, after a British Navy warship sailed near Chinese-controlled artificial islands in the region.

The HMS Albion sailed close to the Paracel Islands on August 31, according to Hua Chunying, a spokesperson for China's Foreign Ministry. Vietnam and Taiwan also claim the island chain.

"Chinese Navy legally verified the ship and warned it to leave," Hua told reporters at a regular news briefing Thursday.

The South China Sea is one of the most heavily disputed regions in the world, with Beijing claiming an enormous swathe of territory from their southern coast, almost to the shore of Malaysia.

To reinforce its claims, the Chinese government has constructed a series of artificial islands with military installations, including radar facilities and airstrips.
