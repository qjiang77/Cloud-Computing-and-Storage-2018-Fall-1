Roy Moore is suing Sacha Baron Cohen over his 'Who is America?' prank|http://nytimes.com/entertainment|http://nytimes.com/2018/09/06/entertainment/roy-moore-sacha-baron-cohen-lawsuit/index.html||2018-09-06|Nicole Chavez,Joe Sutton||(CNN) Failed Republican US Senate candidate Roy Moore has filed a multimillion dollar lawsuit against comedian Sacha Baron Cohen after he fell for a prank on the actor's TV show months after his campaign ended.

The Alabama politician appeared on July 29 on the actor's controversial Showtime series, "Who is America?"

Moore was interviewed by Cohen, who pretended to be an Israeli anti-terrorism expert who had a "pedophile detector." During the episode, the device -- which looks like a hand-held metal detector -- was shown beeping near Moore, implying that he was a pedophile.

The former chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court had faced a firestorm of child molestation and sexual assault allegations during his Senate campaign last year. He has denied any sexual misconduct.
