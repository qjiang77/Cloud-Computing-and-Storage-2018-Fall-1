Progress is slow as hundreds of immigrant children remain separated|http://nytimes.com/us|http://nytimes.com/2018/09/06/politics/family-separations-hundreds-children/index.html||2018-09-06|Tal Kopan||Washington (CNN) A status report Thursday on the effort to reunify families separated by the US government at the border tells a familiar refrain: It is slow going reuniting these families, and hundreds of children remain separated from their parents.

There are more than 600 children who are either still in government custody or were released to someone other than the parents they arrived with (a family member or friend, usually). That includes more than 20 under the age of 5.

Twelve more children have been reunited with their parents in their home countries, the lawyers representing the immigrants said, and there are dozens more who may be cleared for reunification at home soon.

The weekly status reports in the ongoing court case over the government's separation of roughly 2,600 children from their parents at the border have indicated slow progress since the July deadline to reunify all eligible families.

A particularly difficult issue has been the more than 400 parents the government deported without their children before the separations and deportations were halted. The government says those were all voluntary departures, but the American Civil Liberties Union, which brought the lawsuit, and advocates for the immigrants have said many were coerced or did not understand what they were agreeing to.
