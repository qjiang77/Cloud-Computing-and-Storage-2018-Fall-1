(CNN) New York City's Department of Health & Mental Hygiene confirmed Thursday that test results from 10 passengers aboard Emirates Flight 203 who reported cough, fever and symptoms of gastrointestinal illness on Wednesday "showed no illness beyond influenza or other common cold viruses."

Roughly 106 of the more than 500 people on the flight, which originated in Dubai and landed at New York's John F. Kennedy Airport just after 9 a.m. Wednesday, reported symptoms such as coughing, fever or vomiting.

Upon arrival in New York, the plane was taken to a "hard standing area," a Port Authority source told CNN. There, paramedics and officials from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention screened all 549 passengers and crew.
