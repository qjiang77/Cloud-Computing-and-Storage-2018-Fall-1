Sinead McNamara: Australian Instagram influencer died by hanging|http://nytimes.com/australia|http://nytimes.com/2018/09/04/australia/sinead-mcnamara-yacht-death-intl/index.html||2018-09-04|Elinda Labropoulou,Sheena Mckenzie||Athens, Greece (CNN) An Australian Instagram influencer who was found unconscious on a superyacht docked in Greece died by hanging, the coroner in the case told CNN on Tuesday.

Sinead McNamara, 20, regularly posted images of her travels to exotic locations, and said in a post earlier this month that she had been living and working on a boat "seeing all the world has to offer."

News reports and social media posts identified the boat as the Mayan Queen IV , a 93-meter long vessel which is reportedly owned by Mexican billionaire and mining magnate Alberto Baill√®res, but a PR firm for his company said it had no comment.

The PR company for Grupo Bal declined to confirm that the magnate owns the yacht, and said it had no comment on McNamara's death.

McNamara, whose Facebook page described her as hailing from Port Macquarie in the state of New South Wales, was found in critical condition Friday on board the yacht docked in the port of Argostoli on the island of Kefalonia, said the coast guard. She died while being airlifted to hospital.
