The week in 25 photos|http://nytimes.com/us|http://nytimes.com/2018/08/23/world/gallery/week-in-photos-0824/index.html||2018-08-23|||Lee Keum-seom, left, weeps with her son, Ri Sang Chol, at the Mount Kumgang resort in North Korea on Monday, August 20. They hadn't seen each other in 68 years. The two became separated during the Korean War and lived on opposite sides of the demilitarized zone that now splits the two Koreas. Lee, 92, lives in South Korea, and her 71-year-old son lives in North Korea. They were one of the 89 lucky families selected from more than 57,000 who had applied for reunions. The reunions were agreed under the Panmunjom Declaration, which was signed by the leaders of North and South Korea during their historic summit earlier this year.
