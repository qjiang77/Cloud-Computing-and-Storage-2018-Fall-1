'Kidding' showcases Jim Carrey in Mr. Rogers-like role|http://nytimes.com/entertainment|http://nytimes.com/2018/09/07/entertainment/kidding-review/index.html||2018-09-07|Brian Lowry||(CNN) Jim Carrey makes a triumphant return to TV with "Kidding," a Showtime series that reunites him with the director of one of his best movies, "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind." The result is a sweet, melancholy, occasionally funny show that marks one of the new TV season's early highlights.

Owing a thematic debt to Mr. Rogers, albeit with a more jaundiced view of things (including PBS), Carrey plays Jeff, the beloved star of a children's program known as "Mr. Pickles Puppet Time." He's introduced appearing on Conan O'Brien's show, where his cultural footprint is quickly established as the entire audience happily sings along with his signature tune.

Still, in true "tears of a clown" fashion, Jeff is also nursing wounds from an enormous personal loss, one that has left him immersed in grief, estranged from his wife (Judy Greer) and struggling with how to move on.

That anguish risks derailing the "Mr. Pickles" gravy train, a point that's stressed to Jeff -- repeatedly -- by his producer Seb (Frank Langella, terrific even by his standards), who dryly describes the Clark Kent-Superman dynamic at play by telling his star, "Jeff needs to heal. Mr. Pickles is fine."

Directed by Michel Gondry, and created by Dave Holstein, the early episodes of "Kidding" mix a darkly comic streak with genuine angst, flashes of absurdity with potent drama. Surrounded by actors like Langella and Catherine Keener as Deirdre, the show's head puppet maker (with a few issues of her own), Carrey deftly conveys the contradictions that Jeff entails, putting on one face for the world -- along with a vest and tie -- while laboring to hide the turmoil within.
