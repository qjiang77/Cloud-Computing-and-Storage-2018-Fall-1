(CNN) Diego Maradona has returned to football after being appointed manager of Mexican second division club Dorados de Sinaloa.

The Argentine, considered by many as the greatest player in history, is set to replace former boss Francisco Gamez.

The 57-year-old left his last managerial role in April, after failing to secure promotion for UAE side Al Fujairah.

More recently, he was named chairman of Belorussian team Dinamo Brest on a three-year contract last month.

Diego Maradona will take charge of first game on September 15.
