(CNN) The US Food and Drug Administration again has advised consumers "not to eat and discard any Kellogg's Honey Smack cereal" as part of an ongoing salmonella outbreak linked to the popular breakfast product.

In a statement Tuesday, the FDA said an additional 30 people have gotten sick in the multistate outbreak of salmonella illness linked to recalled Kellogg's Honey Smacks cereal. One hundred thirty people have become ill since March, although the outbreak was not announced until June.

Symptoms of salmonella infection include diarrhea, fever and abdominal cramps and typically begin 12 to 72 hours after exposure to the bacteria. The first cases of illness in this outbreak began with symptoms on March 3, and the most recent individuals began feeling ill on July 2.

Symptoms last about four to seven days, and although most people improve without treatment, some may require hospitalization because of severe diarrhea. Thirty-four people have been hospitalized in this outbreak.

Salmonella can also travel from the intestines to the bloodstream and ultimately the rest of the body. Death is rare but may occur if the person is not treated quickly with antibiotics. No deaths have been reported in this outbreak.
