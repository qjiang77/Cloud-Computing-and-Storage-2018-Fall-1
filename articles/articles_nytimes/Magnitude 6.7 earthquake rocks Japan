The Asahi Shimbun/Getty Images Firefighters rescue people who were buried in mud after an earthquake struck Japan's Hokkaido island on Thursday, September 6.

A magnitude 6.7 earthquake struck the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido early on Thursday, September 6, causing landslides that buried a large number of homes at the foot of a ridge.

More than 150 people were injured by the quake, mostly in Sapporo, said Kazuya Isaki, an official with the Crisis Management Office of Hokkaido Prefecture Government. At least seven people were killed, and dozens of people are missing.
