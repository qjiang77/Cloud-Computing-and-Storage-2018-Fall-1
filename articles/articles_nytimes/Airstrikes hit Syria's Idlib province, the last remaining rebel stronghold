Four people were killed and five wounded in the strikes, the White Helmets said on Twitter, also posting images it said were from the attack.

A burned vehicle and personal belongings are seen Saturday in Hass, Syria, after an airstrike.

The strikes occurred a day after Russia, Turkey and Iran failed to agree on a ceasefire in Idlib at a trilateral summit in the Iranian capital.
