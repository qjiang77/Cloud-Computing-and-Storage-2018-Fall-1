People Are Backing This Darlington Woman In Her Feud With House Of Fraser|http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk|http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/people-are-backing-this-darlington-woman-in-her-feud-with-house-of-fraser_uk_5b9380afe4b0162f472d5d16?wfd&utm_hp_ref=uk-homepage||2018-09-08|George Bowden,Reporter,Huffpost Uk||ITV NEWS House-proud Fiona Boston was having none of House of Fraser's excuses over her outstanding sofa order.

When house-proud Fiona Boston bought her new sofa at House of Fraser this summer, she was so besotted she immediately got rid of her old one.

“I was really excited, I thought ‘right, get my skirting boards clean, really get my room ready for this new suite coming’,” she told ITV in an interview.

But after news of the collapse of the high street chain, which went into administration last month before being bought by Sports Direct, Boston admits to having “sleepless nights” over the prospect of never seeing the £2,200 suite she had paid for.

“I’d been taking anodyne and had a headache permanently. I’m worried - it’s a lot of money,” she said.

“I just didn’t seem to be getting anywhere, the phone calls, the emails, so I rang the police.”
