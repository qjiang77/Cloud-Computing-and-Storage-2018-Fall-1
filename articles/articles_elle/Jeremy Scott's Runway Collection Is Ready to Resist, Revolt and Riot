Jeremy Scott's Runway Collection Is Ready to Resist, Revolt and Riot|http://www.elle.com/fashion-week|http://www.elle.com/fashion/g23017927/jeremy-scott-spring-summer-2019-review/||2018-09-07|Nikki||Resist. Revolt. Peace. Riot. If you weren’t sure whether Jeremy Scott was ready for a revolution in the United States, the words emblazoned across the sweaters and sweatshirts that opened his show indicate he is.

Designers have been getting political in the past few seasons, and Scott is joining the fold dressing his loyal soldiers for battle in army surplus jackets, dungaree-boot hybrids, camo print skirts and lug sole boots. Swarovski crystals embellished many of the pieces—after all, this is Jeremy Scott—but this is the designer on a mission.

Clearly influenced (and appalled) by the United States’ current administration, Scott proves there’s room for both fashion and activism — with a reminder to call your Senators and vote NO on a certain Supreme Court Judge nominee.
