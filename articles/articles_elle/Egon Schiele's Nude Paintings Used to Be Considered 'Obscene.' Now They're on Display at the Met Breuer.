Egon Schiele's Nude Paintings Used to Be Considered 'Obscene.' Now They're on Display at the Met Breuer.|http://www.elle.com/in-the-mag|http://www.elle.com/culture/art-design/a22654870/egon-schieles-iconic-nude-paintings-met-breuer/||2018-08-07|Jenna Sauers||The right work of art, encountered at the right moment, can cast a kind of magic spell. I can remember, with a vividness that makes my stomach clench, exactly where I was when I first saw an artwork by Egon Schiele. I was 17 and living in Geneva. One day after school, I attempted to relieve my boredom at an art museum when a strange drawing confronted me. It was a portrait of a woman—I no longer recall her name, or the work’s title—sketched in an expressive, sinuous line, filled with a light wash of watercolor. The woman’s body was contorted, even distended. She was not aestheticized or made beautiful by the artist in a traditional sense, yet I was pulled up short by her erotic allure. The image had power. Years later, an artist friend told me that the most important thing an artist could learn was to “break down the eye.” I think a part of my eye broke and reformed that day. At the time, I only knew I wanted to keep staring. Her hands were magnificent.

More than two dozen works by Schiele are included in the exhibition Obsession: Nudes by Klimt, Schiele, and Picasso From the Scofield Thayer Collection, on view now through October 7 at the Met Breuer in New York. Born in Austria in 1890, Schiele had only a brief career—he died in the influenza pandemic of 1918—but his singular style still endears him to a certain segment of the public (including, probably, this year’s crop of teenagers in the throes of first discovery). Schiele’s pieces predominate in the Met show, and the works on display include one of his famous nude self-portraits: a tender, faintly gothic image of the artist, all spiky hair and haunting eyes, his attenuated body haloed by a wash of white paint. Although female nudes have always been desired by collectors, male nudes are rarer, and nude self-portraits by male artists are even less common; they were practically unheard of in Schiele’s day. Seeing the eye the artist turned on himself—one that refused to idealize the body it regarded, the eye with a vision that bent toward the grotesque—triggers a feeling of great empathy. I suspect Schiele was never harder on anyone than he was on himself.

The pieces in the show by Gustav Klimt are also skilled drawings. Working in the twilight of the Austro-Hungarian empire, in the Vienna of Mahler and Wittgenstein and Freud, Klimt sketched for hours every day, switching from his left hand to his right to stay fresh. The older Austrian artist was a friend and mentor to Schiele, and they sometimes hired the same models. If you are familiar with Klimt only as a painter of massive, glittering, highly decorated canvases (like The Kiss, which I believe is still issued to 75 percent of U.S. college students in poster form), the drawings on view in the exhibit reveal a different side of the artist. Klimt’s sketches are gentler than his bombastic paintings, and much less interested in surface. The artist’s deeper concerns, including his famous generosity toward the women who posed for him and his interest in marginalized sexualities, show through. Klimt, like his protégé́, made drawings that were considered morally questionable in their time, including portraits of women together in bed and women masturbating.

The story of how this trove of erotic art came to be shown is a strange one. The original collector, Scofield Thayer, who willed the pieces currently on display (and many more) to the museum, was from a wealthy New England family. Thayer, an editor, took over a little-remembered literary magazine called the Dial in 1920 and transformed it into an American bastion of modernism. He published T. S. Eliot’s The Waste Land, Thomas Mann’s Death in Venice, and Ezra Pound’s Cantos for the first time in the U.S. Thayer also loved contemporary art and devoted pages of the Dial to works that, at the time, couldn’t be seen outside of European galleries.

For two years between the wars, Thayer lived in Vienna and traveled around Europe, hoovering up artworks that he liked. He soon amassed a collection of nearly 600 pieces. He had good taste and better timing, encountering the work of Klimt and Schiele before either was well-known outside Austria. The artists Thayer collected were drawn to the erotic and were controversial. Later in his life, Pablo Picasso denied authorship of a painting Thayer acquired during a collecting trip to France (even though all evidence points to it being by Picasso’s hand). The painting in question, rarely exhibited, may be a self-portrait that depicts the young artist receiving a blow job from an older, naked woman—probably inspired by an experience Picasso had with a sex worker. Klimt’s renderings of masturbation and lesbianism, and his life-size 1903 painting of a nude pregnant woman, were denounced by critics as sick and pornographic. Schiele, meanwhile, was once brought up on criminal charges after an underage girl ran away from home and spent time at his artist’s studio; he was acquitted of harming the girl, but after his studio was raided, he was convicted on obscenity charges for some of his nude drawings. The judge destroyed one of the works by lighting it on fire in the courtroom, and Schiele completed a despondent series of self-portraits from his jail cell.

Viewing Schiele, Klimt, and Picasso’s works in this show makes one think about what we see, and what we deem unseeable, when it comes to bodies and the people who live in them. It’s hard to imagine a judge today burning a drawing because he doesn’t like what it depicts. But it’s no stretch to imagine private companies determining what images we can see through an internet search. In a world where many people’s first encounters with art take place not in a museum but online, this is troubling. Some of the obscenity trials of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries have had weird digital-age replays, like Facebook’s censorship of French artist Gustave Courbet’s 1866 painting The Origin of the World, which depicts a woman’s vulva. Even more worrisome, to me, are laws such as the recently passed Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act, an innocuous-sounding piece of legislation that theoretically makes tech companies and websites liable for hosting content that could be seen as aiding sex trafficking. Since FOSTA, users have reported Instagram suppressing dozens of hashtags, including #Woman, making any image with that descriptor temporarily invisible to search, presumably to avoid legal liability for any content so categorized. The #Man hashtag seems to have been unaffected.
