The sleeping dragon was strangely realistic—if you can even say a model of a mythical creature is "realistic," that is. Down to its long claws, folded wings, and horned head, the miniature beast looked like it would fit right in with Khaleesi's favored pets. Drogon, is that you?

But according to the brand, this isn't actually a GoT play. Rather, the fiery creatures were inspired by a true story about an author who staged finding a baby dragon in his garage in Oxfordshire, England. When will your faves ever!
