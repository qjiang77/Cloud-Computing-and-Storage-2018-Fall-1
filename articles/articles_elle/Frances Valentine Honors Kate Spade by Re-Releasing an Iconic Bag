Frances Valentine Honors Kate Spade by Re-Releasing an Iconic Bag|http://www.elle.com/fashion|http://www.elle.com/fashion/shopping/g23010216/frances-valentine-kate-spade-tote-bag/||2018-09-06|Nerisha Penrose||When Kate Spade launched her eponymous handbag label in 1993 she offered six different handbag silhouettes that "combined sleek, utilitarian shapes and colorful palettes in an entirely new way." Following her tragic passing in June, Frances Valentine—Spade's new handbag line that launched in 2016—is strengthening Spade's legacy by bringing back one of Spade's iconic silhouette in her honor. On Friday, Sept. 6, Frances Valentine will debut the "Kate" tote, sold exclusively at Barneys for $195. The same boxy, structured silhouette that has become a part of the Kate Spade DNA remains in tact, but this time the tote comes in four autumn-ready colors: green, red, navy, and black. Staying true to Kate Spade's commitment to children's charities, twenty percent of proceeds will be donated to the Boys and Girls Club of America.
