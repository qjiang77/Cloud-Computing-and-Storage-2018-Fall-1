Speaking formally about his fiancée for the first time, Nick gushed about Chopra to Fallon and even outed her attendance at the taping. The camera panned to Priyanka, who was watching from the shadowy wings and threw in her two cents throughout the interview.

The actress particularly spoke out when Fallon asked what Jonas and Chopra's celebrity couple name is. Chopra can be heard yelling "Prick!" in the video, while Nick gave a disapproving laugh. "Oh boy. She likes Prick," he said. "I don’t like that very much."

Jonas also shared the super sweet story of how they met. They were introduce through text by a mutual friend, but didn't end up meeting until six months after. They famously attended the 2017 Met Gala together, which led the public and their friends to suspect they were dating.

Jonas denied any romantic involvement between them at the time and insisted they went as friends. "Our lives were kind of taking us in different places," he said. "People thought we were being coy, and so did we, until we cut to now [and] we're engaged. So, the story sort of wrote itself." The two ended up reconnecting a couple of months ago and decided to give romance a try. "It was immediate," he added. "We knew it was right."
