Ask E. Jean: Am I the Right Woman or the Other Woman?|http://www.elle.com/life-love|http://www.elle.com/life-love/ask-e-jean/a11022/ask-e-jean-serial-cheater-or-seriously-a-sucker-439144/||2018-08-29|E. Jean||Dear E. Jean: I'm a professor at a small liberal arts college. During a very tempestuous four-year relationship with a scientist, I had sex with his colleague, and he retaliated by having sex with my best friend, so we broke up. Only problem is he's now getting married, and we're still talking on the phone constantly and having sex. We'll probably continue to have sex after he's married, because my trouble is that I love him, and I know he loves me. Do I call it quits or try to stop the wedding? Am I the right woman or the other woman? â€”Warped by Love

Warped, my darling: Alas, you're neither the "right woman" nor the "other woman." You're the sucker. If he loved you, you'd be the one he was cheating on. I detest having to be so blunt and giving you more pain, but this scientist needs his atoms split. Block his texts, do not return his idiot calls, remove him from your G-chat. You don't want to be one of those women who never gets over the other woman.
