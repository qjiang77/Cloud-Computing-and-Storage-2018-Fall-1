In an interview with Business of Fashion, Burberry CEO Marco Gobbetti shared more on the luxury house's new commitment to ethical fashion, after it was revealed earlier in July that Burberry destroyed $28 million worth of unsold goods in order to protect the brand.

Burberry explained that the choice to stop burning unsaleable merchandise is part of a five-year initiative the brand launched last year to adopt a more sustainable fashion approach and added that they've already started to "reuse, repair, donate or recycle unsaleable products and we will continue to expand these efforts."

The practice of burning unsold goods is commonplace in the fashion world, as many brands take this approach to prevent the goods from being sold at a discounted price. Cheaper prices also mean clothes will be easily available, which takes away from the exclusivity many designers build their brand around, but Burberry is eager to introduce a new kind of luxury.



“Modern luxury means being socially and environmentally responsible. This belief is core to us at Burberry and key to our long-term success," Marco Gobbetti, chief executive officer, said. "We are committed to applying the same creativity to all parts of Burberry as we do to our products.”



In addition to the end of their bonfire of luxury goods, Burberry will also stop using real fur in future collections, including Ricardo Tisci's debut collection this September. Just another move to mark a change in the designer house.
