Here, she reflects on three decades of career milestones.

1973: Secures first job

“I was a waitress at an assisted-living facility in Florida. My mom didn’t have much money. We’d try to get money out of her: a dollar every time she said a curse word, a dollar every time she smoked a cigarette. She was like, ‘Get out of here, get a job.’ ”

1976: Attends Yale

“I got to Yale and worked in the cafeteria. I had this idea in my head that superintelligent beings were accepted, and somehow I’d just snuck in. [Laughs] After graduating, I got into the drama school, so I stayed in New Haven for seven years."

1983: Performs Off-Broadway

“I’d be downtown at La MaMa or uptown at Frank Silvera Writers’ Workshop. Doing the writers’ workshop only pays, like, 12 dollars. You’re getting enough for subway tokens and maybe lunch. It’s exciting, but you still have to pay rent.”

1988: Moves to L.A.

“In the ’80s, [people] were heading to to L.A. to seek fame and fortune. I crashed on a friend’s couch when I first got there. In 30 days, I got my first job: A Man Called Hawk, with Avery Brooks.”

Frank Trapper

A favorite moment? The car scene at the end of the movie. We really have the radio on. A song starts playing, and we just start singing. I guess they had to go get clearance for the song then. [Laughs]”

1998: Stars in How Stella Got Her Groove Back

We got to shoot in Jamaica with Whoopi [Goldberg] and a young Taye Diggs. Whoopi was generous and wonderful. It was so much fun—just a hoot every day, laughing, joking, improvising.”

2013-2016: Costars in FX series American Horror Story

Michele K. Short

“I went into Ryan [Murphy’s] office, and he began to talk about these witches in Boston and New Orleans, and the Voodoo Queen. I said, ‘Marie Laveau?’ His eyes opened a little bit. Years ago, I went there with my husband [Courtney B.Vance] for our anniversary, and we dove into that culture. I just love the Voodoo Queen.”

2018: Plays Black Panther’s queen of Wakanda

Marvel Studios

"I got a call from [director] Ryan Coogler. He said, ‘I’m interested in you playing Ramonda.’ There was no script, but having just seen Fruitvale Station and Creed, I’d seen the quality and heart of his work. It was about the company you keep."

2018: Joins Tom Cruise in Mission Impossible--Fallout

Chiabella James

“Erica Sloane is the head of the CIA. She’s a great chess player, but she’s been underestimated in her career. She’s badass and strong and bright, but the only stunt I did was have a conversation with Tom in extreme cold.”
