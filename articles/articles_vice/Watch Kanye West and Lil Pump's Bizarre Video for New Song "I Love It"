And at some point, no doubt, we're all going to have a nice long talk about this. In the meantime, here's a video for "I Love It," a new song from West and Lil Pump. It was directed by West and Amanda Adelson; Spike Jonze was the executive producer; West repeats, five times, "I'm a sick fuck / I like a quick fuck." Watch the video at the top of the page.
