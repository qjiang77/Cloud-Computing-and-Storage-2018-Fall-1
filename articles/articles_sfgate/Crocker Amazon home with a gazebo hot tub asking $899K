Looking for a hot tub at a cool price? Then check out 1133 Athens Street in Crocker Amazon. The three-bedroom, two bath is asking $899,000.

That price includes a large lot with a manicured front and backyard, a stone patio centered around a mature tree, and the aforementioned hot tub. But this isn’t just any hot tub, tucked away under a back deck. No, this hot tub is the centerpiece of the backyard, situated inside a wood and glass gazebo with a large skylight on the roof.

Obviously the long-time owners (the home last sold in 1993) are big fans of indoor-outdoor living. In fact, one of the two upstairs bedrooms leads out to a glass-enclosed back deck. But while the outside is well loved, some of the indoor spaces could use a little work.

Both full bathrooms (one upstairs and one downstairs) need major updates. The kitchen is an incongruous mix of what appear to be the original 1924 cabinets and grey wood-like laminate flooring. The more modern flooring extends to the breakfast nook and laundry area, though much of the home’s upstairs retains its original hardwood floors. (The downstairs bedroom, like the downstairs bath, is a more-recent “unwarranted” add on.)

More original details are on display in the showpiece living room. It has a brick fireplace (converted to gas), glass built ins, leaded stained glass windows and beautiful coved ceilings. There are similar ceilings in the dining room, as well as a passthrough window to the kitchen. But we have a feeling the new owners will be ditching that striped wallpaper—fast.

Speaking of speed, interested parties better move quick. Redfin expects the home to be in contract any day now.
