Finding classic Victorians that not only made it through the 1906 earthquake but also through the hands of would-be modernizers can be daunting in San Francisco. But 2825 Pine, circa 1887, is a well-preserved beauty on the market now for $2.495 million.

All total, the home has four beds and three baths. The main home consists of three beds and two baths, a formal dining room, sunroom, and office. The home also offers a one-car garage.

Below this main house is a separate one bed/one bath with patio access. According to the MLS information, this apartment has recently rented for $3,107 a month (a price that seems right in line with the current median for San Francisco).

At 2,280 square feet, this grand lady asks $2.495 million, which breaks down to $1094 per square foot. The property last sold in 2006, for $1.395 million.

Thatâ€™s a lot of pricey math, but then, 2825 Pine is a historic Victorian in lower Pacific Heights. And it comes with built-in support for the jumbo loan required to buy it!
