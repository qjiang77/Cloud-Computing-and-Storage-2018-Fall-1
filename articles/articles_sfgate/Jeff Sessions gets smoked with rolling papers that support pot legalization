Jeff Sessions gets smoked with rolling papers that support pot legalization|http://www.sfgate.com/cannabis|https://blog.sfgate.com/smellthetruth/2018/03/05/jeff-sessions-gets-smoked-with-rolling-papers-that-support-pot-legalization/?search=cannabis||2018-03-05|Oscar Pascual||Jeff Sessions’ weed-hating face will now help fund efforts to legalize cannabis.

An advocacy group has released a line of rolling papers branded with a picture of the attorney general smoking a joint, reports Newsweek.

The papers are sold online as a novelty brand called General Jeff’s Old Rebel Session Papers and features a cartoon depiction of a fully-lit Sessions. A portion of each of the $5 packs will be donated to the Drug Policy Alliance.

“We’re not criminals, junkies or idiots,” their website reads. “Regular Jeffs all over the country—good, responsible, patriotic Americans—have a sesh now and then… and it’s OK!”

Sessions reversed an Obama-era memo protecting state legalized marijuana programs from federal interference in January. His anti-pot stance has been documented for over 20 years.

“Our intent in actually making these papers is to poke a little good-natured fun at our Attorney General, who doesn’t seem to have changed his mind or read any news about cannabis since the Nixon-era,” a representative told Newsweek. “His ideas about marijuana have the potential to harm millions of Americans who use this plant safely and legally in 2018.”
