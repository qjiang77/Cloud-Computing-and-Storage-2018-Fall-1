State Department confirms Pompeo received letter from Kim to Trump|http://www.cnn.com/world|http://www.cnn.com/2018/09/08/politics/donald-trump-kim-jong-un-letter-intl/index.html||2018-09-08|Euan Mckirdy,Elise Labott||(CNN) Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has received a letter from Kim Jong Un to US President Donald Trump, according to a State Department official.

The official confirmed what Trump had told reporters earlier Friday, that a letter was handed over at the Korean DMZ on Thursday and is now en route to him.

"A letter is being delivered to me, a personal letter from Kim Jong Un to me. That was handed at the border, I don't know if you know that, but it was handed at the border yesterday," he told the press aboard Air Force One, adding that he believes it will be a "positive" letter.

"It's being delivered. It's actually an elegant way. The way it used to be many years ago before we had all the new contraptions that we all use," Trump said. "But a letter is being delivered to me and I think it's going to be a positive letter."

It is not the first missive between the two leaders. Senior North Korean official Kim Yong Chol hand delivered a letter to Trump at the White House before the two men met in Singapore in September, and several have changed hands since then.
