Australians urged to get tested for syphilis after unborn baby dies|http://www.cnn.com/australia|http://www.cnn.com/2018/08/10/health/australia-syphilis-baby-death-screenings-intl/index.html||2018-08-10|Euan Mckirdy||(CNN) Australians are being urged to get tested for syphilis after a rise in cases of the sexually transmitted infection (STI), which recently caused the death of an unborn baby.

Around 1,340 cases of syphilis were recorded in Victoria in 2017, an increase of 41% on two years prior and a record high.

Congenital syphilis -- the form of the infection passed from mother to child, which can cause serious birth defects and worse -- also saw a reemergence for the first time since 2004, with two cases recorded last year, including one instance of fetal death.

"Screening at risk groups, including antenatal screening, and adequate timely treatment of cases and sexual partners are crucial for the prevention of syphilis infections," an alert from the Victoria state health authority said Thursday.

A "large majority" of cases occur in males, the alert said, with almost three quarters reporting male sexual partners as the source of infection. Contracting syphilis makes the patient more susceptible to acquiring and transmitting HIV, the alert added.
