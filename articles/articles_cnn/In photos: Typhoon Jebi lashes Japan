Nobuki Ito/Kyodo News via AP A building's scaffolding collapses after Typhoon Jebi hit Osaka, Japan, on Tuesday.

Typhoon Jebi, the strongest typhoon to make landfall in Japan in 25 years, brought heavy rain and wind to the country's southern prefectures Tuesday, overturning cars and causing storm surges that swamped an airport's runways in Izumisano.

The storm's powerful winds also made a tanker crash into a bridge that connects the airport with the mainland.

More than 8,000 residents sought shelter in 1,667 evacuation shelters, the Fire and Disaster Management Agency said Wednesday.

Before the storm made landfall, it had sustained winds of 140 kilometers per hour (87 mph) and gusts of 165 kmh (102 mph). That's the equivalent of a Category 1 hurricane in the Atlantic.
