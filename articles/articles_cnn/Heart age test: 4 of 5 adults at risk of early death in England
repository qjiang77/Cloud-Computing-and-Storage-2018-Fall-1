Heart age test: 4 of 5 adults at risk of early death in England|http://www.cnn.com/health|http://www.cnn.com/2018/09/04/health/england-heart-health-intl/index.html||2018-09-04|Hilary Clarke||(CNN) The vast majority of English adults are at risk of cardiac arrest or stroke due to unhealthy lifestyles that are making their hearts age prematurely, according to the government agency Public Health England.

Because of obesity, high blood pressure and lack of exercise, among other reasons, 78% of over-30s who have taken PHE's Heart Age Test have hearts that are older than they should be, the agency said in a statement.

And 14% have hearts that are 10 years older than their actual age, an analysis of tests taken by 1.9 million people showed.

The free test is being offered by PHE as part of a nationwide campaign to reduce the number of people who die from vascular disease, which stands at 84,100 annually.

PHE estimates a quarter of these deaths occur among those under 75, and up to 50 deaths a day would not have happened if the victim had looked after his or her heart health better.
