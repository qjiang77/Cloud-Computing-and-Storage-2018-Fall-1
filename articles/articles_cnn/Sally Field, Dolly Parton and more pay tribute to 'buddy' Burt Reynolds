Sally Field, Dolly Parton and more pay tribute to 'buddy' Burt Reynolds|http://www.cnn.com/entertainment|http://www.cnn.com/2018/09/06/entertainment/celebrities-react-burt-reynolds-death/index.html||2018-09-06|Sandra Gonzalez||(CNN) Co-stars, friends and famous admirers of actor Burt Reynolds are paying tribute to the late legend upon news of his death .

Reynolds, 82, died Thursday after suffering a cardiac arrest, according to his agent Todd Eisner.

"There are times in your life that are so indelible, they never fade away. They stay alive, even forty years later. My years with Burt never leave my mind," said actress Sally Field, whom Reynolds once called "the love of my life." "He will be in my history and my heart, for as long as I live. Rest, Buddy."

Field and Reynolds were co-stars in 1977's "Smokey and the Bandit," one of Reynolds's most famous films.

Another one of his former co-stars, Dolly Parton, with whom he starred in 1982's "The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas," also expressed her sadness over the actor's passing.

"I know we will always remember his funny laugh, that mischievous sparkle in his eyes, and his quirky sense of humor," she wrote. "You will always be my favorite sheriff, rest in peace my little buddy. I will always love you, Dolly."

The range of Reynolds' talent and the memorable roles he played is reflected in the films for which he's being remembered -- everything from "Deliverance" to "Boogie Nights," in which he played a director of adult films.

Director Kevin Smith called Reynolds "THE movie star of my childhood."

"I always loved how Burt Reynolds worked with his friends as often as he could and then showcased the fun of movie-making in the end credits of his flicks," he wrote on Twitter. "He was true American icon. Hate to see him go..."
