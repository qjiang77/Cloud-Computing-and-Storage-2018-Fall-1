Lula da Silva: Brazil court bars former president from running again|http://www.cnn.com/americas|http://www.cnn.com/2018/09/01/americas/brazil-lula-da-silva-court-ruling-intl/index.html||2018-09-01|Laura Smith-Spark,Taylor Barnes||(CNN) Brazil's top electoral court has barred former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva from running for reelection because of a corruption conviction, just weeks before Brazilians go to the polls for a vote in which he was considered a frontrunner despite being in prison.

Six of seven justices from the Supreme Electoral Tribunal in Brasilia ruled that Lula was ineligible to run in October, while one voted in favor in a hearing stretching late into Friday night.

Brazilian law bars candidates whose conviction has been upheld on appeal.

Universally known as Lula, Lula da Silva is a founding member of Brazil's only socialist political party, Partido dos Trabalhadores (PT), the Workers' Party.

A former metalworker and union leader, he rose through the political ranks to serve two terms as president between 2003 and 2011. He left office with a 90% approval rating, after his policies helped to lift millions of Brazilians out of poverty.
