Guantanamo Bay Naval Station Fast Facts|http://www.cnn.com/world|http://www.cnn.com/2013/09/09/world/guantanamo-bay-naval-station-fast-facts/index.html||2013-09-09|Cnn Library||(CNN) Here's a look at Guantánamo Bay Naval Station and its detention facilities.

The base, sometimes referred to as "Gitmo," is located in southeastern Cuba , on the coast of Guantánamo Bay.

The United States has been leasing the 45 square miles that the base sits on since 1903. The base shares a 17-mile fenced border with Cuba.

The lease can only be terminated by mutual agreement.

During the administration of President George W. Bush (2001-2009), the United States claimed that Guantánamo Bay detainees were not on US soil and therefore not covered by the US Constitution , and that " enemy combatant " status meant they could be denied some legal protections.

More than 700 detainees have been held at Guantánamo since it opened. Peak population was 684 detainees in June 2003.
