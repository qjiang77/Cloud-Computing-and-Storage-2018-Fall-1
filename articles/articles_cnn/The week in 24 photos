Kamala Harris questions Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh during his confirmation hearing on Wednesday, September 5. The Democrat pressed Kavanaugh about whether he had discussed special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation with anyone. After answering "with other judges I know," Kavanaugh was asked if he had discussed the probe with anyone who works at Kasowitz Benson Torres, the New York law firm founded by President Donald Trump's personal attorney Marc Kasowitz. Kavanaugh replied that he's unsure he knows everyone who works at that law firm and asked the senator if there was a specific person she was talking about.
