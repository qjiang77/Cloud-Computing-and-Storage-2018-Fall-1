Making It in San Diego: Sleeping cabins built for homeless|http://cnn.com/us|https://www.10news.com/news/making-it-in-san-diego/making-it-in-san-diego-sleeping-cabins-built-for-homeless||2018-09-08|Natay Holmes||SAN DIEGO (KGTV)- There's a tiny solution aimed at tackling a big problem for those struggling to make it in San Diego. Volunteers hope to build small sleeping cabins for the homeless.

On Friday, the nonprofit organization Amikas built a model of what the cabin will look like. Volunteer Evie Kosower says the sleeping quarters will be 96 square feet and could house up to four people. Kosower says "living on the street particularly for women and children, which our mission, is very dangerous. They are the most vulnerable people on the street."

The tiny cabin is being donated to the Alpha Project downtown. The cost for each one is $2,500. Amikas would like to have a community of ten to twenty cabins, along with a community center that would include amenities like showers.

Volunteers say their most significant problem with building more cabins is that there is nowhere to put them at the moment. "The city has decided not to give us any place to put them, and so we're left to decide how we get that to happen."

Amikas volunteers say they hope city leaders will decide on a possible location after seeing the model. 10News reached out to the Mayor's office Friday. We are waiting to hear back.
