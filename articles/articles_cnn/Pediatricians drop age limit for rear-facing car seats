Pediatricians drop age limit for rear-facing car seats|http://www.cnn.com/health|http://www.cnn.com/2018/08/30/health/car-seat-rear-facing-recommendation-change/index.html||2018-08-30|Jamie Gumbrecht||(CNN) Children should ride in rear-facing car seats until they reach the height or weight limit for the seat, according to updated recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics.

By using the proper car seat, the risk of death or serious injury is lowered by more than 70%, according to the academy. All children younger than 13 years should be in a vehicle's back seat, it said.
