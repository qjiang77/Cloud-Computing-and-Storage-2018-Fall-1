Trump risks midterm backlash if he expands China trade war with tariffs|http://www.cnbc.com|http://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/07/trump-risks-midterm-backlash-if-he-widens-china-trade-war-with-tariffs.html||2018-09-07|Jacob Pramuk,Win Mcnamee,Getty Images||The numbers listed below show the proportion who believe tariffs will "protect American jobs and help the U.S. economy," followed by those who think they will "raise the costs of consumer goods and hurt the U.S. economy," then those who say the actions will not have much of an effect.

Illinois: 24 percent/43 percent/20 percent (-19)

Indiana: 29 percent/41 percent/19 percent (-12)

Missouri: 28 percent/44 percent/14 percent (-16)

Pennsylvania: 28 percent/46 percent/14 percent (-18)

Tennessee: 28 percent/41 percent/17 percent (-13)

Texas: 33 percent/40 percent/15 percent (-7)

A spreading trade conflict could have ripple effects as Republicans try to defend their House and Senate majorities. Pennsylvania and Texas both hold important Senate races as well as a handful of battleground House contests with mostly Republicans defending seats.

Voters in Indiana, Missouri and Tennessee will decide on three of this year's most competitive Senate races, in which Democrats try to hold off GOP challengers. Meanwhile, a few Republican incumbents will also try to keep their seats in Illinois, a major farm state.

While NBC and Marist polled those six states in recent weeks, tariffs also could affect important races in farm states such as North Dakota and Montana.
