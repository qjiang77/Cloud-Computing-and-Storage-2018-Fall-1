The firm reiterated its buy rating for Salesforce stock, predicting the cloud computing software company will report sales growth above expectations this fiscal year.

Salesforce will report its fiscal second-quarter results on Aug. 29.

"We believe that CRM will meet or exceed consensus F2Q billings growth," analyst John DiFucci said in a note to clients Wednesday. "Our Enterprise checks reflect strong results, particularly in Europe and across verticals," and a healthy pipeline for the second half of the year, he said.
