Visalia-based San Joaquin Valley Homes announced it has closed on a deal for 15 acres of Porterville-area farmland to build an 80-home subdivision.

The $18-million “Cambria” project will break ground this month on Henderson Avenue in Porterville with single-family homes ranging from 1,297 to 1,597 square feet with open floorplans, three bedrooms and two bathrooms on lots ranging from 4,750 to 5,840 square feet.

It is the 21st joint venture project with lending partner Presidio Residential Capital, a San Diego-based real estate investment company that bankrolls the projects.

Founded in 2013 by Joe Leal, Jim Robinson and Randy Merrill, SJV Homes has sold more than 1,000 homes, making it one of the most active homebuilders in the region, according to a news release.
