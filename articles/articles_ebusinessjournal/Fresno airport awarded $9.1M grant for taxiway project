Fresno Yosemite International Airport announced it was awarded a $9.1 million airport infrastructure grant from the Federal Aviation Administration.

The funds are for the second phase of the Taxiway C Reconstruction Project. Last year, the FAA provided the initial $13.3 million grant for the first phase of the project currently underway.

The project is expected to be complete in late 2019.

“As a major air transportation hub for California’s Central Valley, infrastructure projects such as Taxiway C are vital to sustaining safe, well-maintained facilities to serve the nation’s aviation system,” said Director of Aviation Kevin Meikle. “The nearly 150 construction jobs related to the Taxiway C project contributes to the Airport’s significant economic contribution for the region.”

Taxiway C handles nearly 100,000 annual aircraft operations serving as the primary taxiway for commercial, military, general aviation, cargo, law enforcement, and medical and firefighting aircraft. Identified as a priority airfield project consistent with Fresno Yosemite International Airport’s FAA-Mandated Pavement Management Plan, the reconstruction includes the removal and replacement of existing pavements, lighting, markings and drainage facilities.
