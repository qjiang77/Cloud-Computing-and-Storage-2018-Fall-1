Investors sold high-dividend stocks as bond yields rose, and tech stocks rebounded from recent losses.

Tesla slumped 6.3 percent after its chief accounting officer quit after only a month, and CEO Elon Musk was seen appearing to smoke marijuana during an interview.

The S&P 500 lost 6 points, or 0.2 percent, at 2,871.

The Dow Jones fell 79 points, or 0.3 percent, at 25,916, and the Nasdaq composite is dropped 20 points, or 0.3 percent, at 7,902.

The yield on the 10-year Treasury note jumped to 2.94 percent from 2.87 percent late Thursday.

U.S. stock indexes are falling in early trading Friday after a surprisingly strong jobs report pushed investors to gird for higher interest rates. Not only is hiring still strong, but wages rose last month at their fastest pace in eight years. That should give the Federal Reserve more leeway to continue raising rates.

The S&P 500 is down 10 points, or 0.4 percent, at 2,867 and is on pace for its fourth straight down day.

The Dow Jones is down 102, or 0.4 percent, at 25,893, and the Nasdaq composite is down 47, or 0.6 percent, at 7,874.

The yield on the 10-year Treasury note jumped to 2.92 percent from 2.87 percent late Thursday.
