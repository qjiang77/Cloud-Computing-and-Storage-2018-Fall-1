The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs California Health Care System in Fresno cut the ribbon Friday for their new Community Living Center building at Fresno Street and Clinton Avenue.

“It’s all about delivering high-quality care and one that you’ll see as you walk through here is [that it’s] really patient-centered,” said Stephen Bauman, director of the VA Central California Health Care System, Fresno. “It’s a homelike atmosphere, so that’s new to the VA— this is one of the first facilities that’s doing that and we’re really proud of that.”

This is the first phase of an expansion to provide residential care to retired veterans in the Valley. The 15,000-square-foot building will hold two six-bed facilities, with the second being opened at a later time. Construction took 15 months and cost $9.7 million. The VA hopes to have room for 60 permanent residents when the final project is done.
