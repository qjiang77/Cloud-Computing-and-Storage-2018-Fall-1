She is the reigning 2017 PBC Player of the Year and a third-team All-America selection by the Division II Conference Commissioners Association and United Soccer Coaches, after a season in which she scored a PBC-leading 19 goals and notched six assists.



Bartholomew led the Bobcats to an 11-6 overall record, with a 7-3 mark in conference play and a trip to the PBC Tournament quarterfinal. Over the course of the season, she scored eight game-winning goals and earned two Conference Player of the Week awards. She is one of seven returning seniors on this year’s team.



The Georgia College Department of Athletics, two-time winners of the PBC Commissioner’s Cup, sponsors 11 varsity athletic programs at the NCAA Division II level.
