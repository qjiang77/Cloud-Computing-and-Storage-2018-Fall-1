The Fayetteville City Council on Sept. 6 gave consultants and city staff the go-ahead to begin negotiations with the top firm potentially selected for the design of the new City Hall on Stonewall Avenue and the greenspace and park area to be situated behind the new facility.

Decatur firm Office of Design was at the top of four firms interviewed by the selection committee headed by consultant Comprehensive Program Services.

The council unanimously approved the request to approve the ranking of the four firms, thus giving the selection committee and city staff the ability to begin negotiations with Office of Design.

Comprehensive representative Eric Johnson said the city received nine proposals which were short-listed to five firms. One of those on the short list did not make a presentation.

The city previously purchased the school system central office property and former bus barn area from the Fayette County Board of Education.

The school system is currently working to have central office staff move to the Lafayette Education Center a couple of blocks away. That move is expected by the end of the year.

The central office building is expected to be demolished next year to make way for the eventual construction of the new City Hall building beginning in 2019.
