What’s it like to stand in the wings, preparing to give your TED Talk and share a big idea to create ripples of change? This video, captured at TED2018, gives a taste of that. It follows the first speakers of The Audacious Project, TED’s new initiative to fund big ideas for global change. These speakers had a lot on the line as they gave their talks — in addition to a packed house at the conference, their talks were viewed around the world via Facebook Watch. And they all crushed it, sharing their ideas with unique power. (Want goosebumps? Watch Robin Steinberg’s talk about ending the injustice of the US bail system.)

Have an idea for the social good that feels in the same spirit? Apply to be a part of The Audacious Project next year. Applications are open now through June 10, 2018 — and the questionnaire is intentionally short to encourage you to apply. So go for it. Share your biggest, wildest vision for how to tackle one of the world’s most pressing problems.
