Showtime's Kidding Allows Jim Carrey to Channel Mr. Rogers|http://www.ign.com/tv|https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/09/07/showtimes-kidding-allows-jim-carrey-to-channel-mr-rogers-ign-first||2018-09-07|||Share. Puppets are better than people. Puppets are better than people.

All September long, IGN is spotlighting the best TV coming your way in the 2018-2019 season. Today we're taking a look at Jim Carrey's highly-anticipated return to the small screen with Showtime's new series, Kidding, premiering September 9. The series mixes inspiration from Sesame Street, Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood and The Truman Show into a half-hour format that is equal parts heartfelt, dramatic, and downright surreal.

With Kidding, Showtime steps into the tried and true world of children's entertainment -- kind of. The series sets out to explore the challenges of preserving kindness against the backdrop of an unkind world. With its premiere just days away -- Kidding premieres Sunday, September 9 on Showtime -- IGN can exclusively reveal a first-look image, which gives a peek at Mr. Pickles and one of his "Puppet Time" friends and co-stars in the first episode, titled "Green Means Go."

Jim Carrey plays the titular role of Mr. Jeff Pickles, a beloved fictional pop culture hero who is reminiscent, of course, of American icon Mr. Fred Rogers. In Kidding, Jeff struggles to keep his personal life together after an unspeakable tragedy upends things, leaving his on-screen alter-ego, and the puppet world he created, as the last safe space he's able to turn to.

Needless to say, the dynamic between innocent and evil, light and dark, and fictional and real is consistently explored in this series. "I wanted to write a show about a kind man in a cruel world," creator and showrunner Dave Holstein tells IGN. "I wanted to take a character with the depth of kindness and real genuine honesty of a Mr. Rogers type and then just see what it would take to just destroy them. In doing so, we try to find this universal theme of, 'Can we be good, ourselves, in a world that is so increasingly dark?'"

In that context, Kidding should be looked at as the antithesis of the recent smattering of popular anti-hero shows to grace the small-screen, from The Sopranos to Breaking Bad. In short, Jeff Pickles is no Walter White. "Let's do a story not about someone trying to break bad, but stay good," Holstein continues, explaining his initial pitch. "Which is, you know, a weirdly subversive thought ... to try and do a show where your main character is a nice person and everything around him is awful."

Here to preserve Mr. Pickles' kindness, and possibly even his sanity, is "Mr. Pickles' Puppet Time," the beloved fictional children's show he became famous for in the series. As deeply as Jim Carrey worked with Michel Gondry and the crew to develop his character, Holstein admits the same sort of detailed attention was given to the show's puppets, and it's show-within-a-show component, as well.

"[Kidding] lives and dies on if you can believe our show-within-the-show really exists," Holstein continues. "What we really didn't want to do was spoof children's television. It's too easy, it's been done a thousand different ways. We're not 'Death to Smoochy.' We're not a satire. So the first thing I did was hire Joey Mazzarino, who was the head writer on 'Sesame Street,' to join our writers' room and help us build from the ground up a legit children's television show with a real mythology, a real language built into child psychology and child development, so that whenever we were writing a song for that world, or writing a sketch for that world, we weren't making fun of that world."

Upon viewing the first episode, it's easy to see how Kidding would be lumped in with the likes of Death to Smoochy, and through a different lens, the series could easily be viewed as a horror story. It's a fine line that Kidding walks, and as much as Holstein would love to do "Mr. Rogers becomes Dexter," he notes that such a gimmick would lose steam after three episodes.

"I think that the challenging part is to bring out the darkness of a character, acknowledge that we all have a little darkness in ourselves, and, yet, try really really hard to make you empathize with him, and sort of expose the fact that we all have a duality. We all have a dark side and a light side," Holstein continues. "If your core, like Jeff, is really, really warm, and really, really generous, and really, really genuine and full of love, how far can you push the dark side before the audience breaks with him? It's a really fun challenge from a writing perspective and something the writers' room wanted to attempt, because we hadn't really seen that done. What we have seen done is the part where he just kills everybody. I wanted people to be rooting for him ... not to become the bad guy, but for him to stay good and provide hope to people -- to regain a balance that is more light. I think over the course of the season, we achieve just that."

Kidding premieres Sunday, September 9 at 10 p.m. ET/PT on Showtime.
