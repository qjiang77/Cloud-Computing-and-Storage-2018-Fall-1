Marvel's Ironheart is getting her own comic book series that will be out on shelves in Nov.

In an interview with Chicago Tribune, poet and playwright Eve L. Ewing discusses her vision for the upcoming Marvel comic she will be penning.

“Periodically I have to sit back and go, ‘Omigosh, I’m a Marvel writer’ — there’s nothing more implausible and more amazing that’s ever happened to me,” Ewing said.

The series, simply titled Ironheart, follows a black, teen girl from Chicago who is highly intelligent and goes by the name of Riri Williams, also known as Ironheart. She is able to re-create the Iron Man suit by herself without any resources from Tony Stark, who ends up mentoring her for a brief period.

Art will be done by Kevin Libranda and the comic will heavily focus on exploring the Chicago area.

"Previous writers put in so much, in terms of beginning her autobiographical details," Ewing said. "But as a Chicagoan, I want to get down and dirty — like where did Riri go to high school? What bus does she take? Does she eat hot chips?"

Ewing said that adding in those details is what is going to make Riri a full three-dimensional character.

IGN found out the news of the new female Iron Man alias back in 2016, and Ironheart made her debut in Invincible Iron Man #1 that Oct. Stay tuned to IGN for more details on Ironheart as they release!
