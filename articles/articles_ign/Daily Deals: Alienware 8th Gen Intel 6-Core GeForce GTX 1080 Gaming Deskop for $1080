Today's Newest Deals

Our review is up and our editor Jonathon Dornbrush loves it!

Paying $1K for any fully warrantied pre-built gaming desktop equipped with a GeForce GTX 1080 would be a fabulous deal. Lucky for you, this is an Alienware Aurora, one of the highest end models in Dell's gaming lineup.

Use code "SAVE17" to get it at Dell for $1078.99

You can save an additional $40 by choosing the XPS chassis instead.

Crazy deal! If you want a big TV without breaking your budget, here's a 55" 4K Smart-enabled HDTV for $300, plus you can extend the warranty to 3 years for a measly $26. To top it all off, you get free 2-day shipping... on a 55" TV. Since you're getting it at Walmart, returns are easy too, since you can do it at any retail location.

Specs include the latest gen Intel Core i5-8400 6-core processor, 8GB RAM, 1TB HDD, and GeForce GTX 1070 video card.

Use code "SAVE17" to get it at Dell for $995.99

Again, save about $40 if you pick the XPS chassis instead.

Scour the internet for a brand new, fully warrantied pre-built GeForce GTX 1080 Ti equipped gaming desktop PC and I guarantee you won't find one.

This config has an Intel Core i7 hexacore processor with unlocked multiplier for better overclocking potential.

If you're looking for the ultimate beast in gaming monitors, the Alienware AW3418DW should be a tops on your list. Specs include a 34" 3440x1440 curved IPS panel display with super wide viewing angles and 99% sRGB coverage, 4ms response time, NVIDIA G-SYNC compatibility, up to 120Hz refresh rate, and RGB lighting.

This is easily the lowest price out there for a GeForce GTX 1070 Ti (everyone else has it for well over $400). Not surprisingly, this card benches right in between the GeForce GTX 1070 and 1080. However, in many real world games, it performs just as well as the GTX 1080.

This sweet looking keyboard features mechanical Brown switches (quiet with tactile feedback), anti-ghosting and N-key rollover on all keys, onboard memory with 15 programmable macro key functions with on-the-fly recording, and RGB backlighting on the keys and the underside.

This sweet looking PS4 Pro has been going in and out of stock (mostly out of stock). Includes the highly anticipated Marvel Spider-Man game and a themed PS4 Pro console with matching controller.

Includes both Blade Runner 2049 and Blade Runner: The Final Cut.

I have a Masterbuilt electric smoker and I've used it almost every week this summer. Going with an electric (digital) smoker has a few major advantages. First and foremost, you have precise temperature control compared to traditional charcoat or pellet smokers. Cleanup is also much, much easier, which means you're likely to use it more often. Best of all, you still get the same smokey wood flavor you get with any proper smoker.

The Botvac D3 retails for $399.99 and it's currently sold for $300 or more elsewhere, including Amazon. Neato Botvacs are considered just as good (if not better) than comparable Roomba models and is a well known brand that is sold at Bed Bath & Beyond, Kohls, Best Buy, and more. This particular model features laser mapping, WiFi control via your smartphone app, and will automatically go back to the dock to charge.

Click on "Click Here To See Your Price" and then manually go to your shopping cart. OLEDs are considered to be the king of HDTVs. They offer phenomenal contrast ratio, best-in-class black levels, and HDR.

These TVs come with a 90-day return policy, and since it is Walmart, you can always return the TV at a physical location if you need to. If you want to be extra safe, you can purchase an extended 3-year warranty plan for only $58.

This is the best price I've seen for a GTX 1060-equipped Alienware laptop. The GTX 1060 is more than capable of driving any game at this screen's 1080p native resolution, and it performs well on VR games for the Rift and Vive. Specs include a 15.6" 1080p IPS panel display, Intel Core i5-7300 quad-core processor, 8GB RAM, 1TB HDD, and GeForce GTX 1060 6GB video card.

Specs include a 15.6" 1080p IPS panel display, Intel Core i5-8300H 4-core processor, 8GB RAM, 1TB HDD, and GeForce GTX 1050 video card.

This model (MR6Y2LL/A) currently sells for $459 elsewhere, including the Apple St ore. The newest generation supports the Apple Pencil, much like the pricier iPad Pro.

This super popular set normally sells for $112.99, but today it has been discounted an extra 23% off. This set includes all 85 remastered episodes of the Batman animated TV series on Blu-ray as well as three Funko Pops and a deluxe art book. The release date has been pushed to October 30.

Both NES and Super NES Classic Minis are available with free 2-day shipping.

For only $9.99 per course, you can train yourself in tools, software, and programming languages specific to the gaming industry. I and other people here have used Udemy and would easily recommend one of these hugely informative courses for the same cost as a Switch screen protector.
