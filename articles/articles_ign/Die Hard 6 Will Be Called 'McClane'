Die Hard 6 will officially be called "McClane."

Speaking to Empire, the film's producer Lorenzo di Bonaventura revealed the title while also confirming Bruce Willis will heavily feature in the movie.

Die Hard 6, originally rumored to be called Die Hard: Year One, will follow a 60-year-old McClane and a younger McClane in his 20s as well. But despite the supposed time jumps, di Bonaventura has reassured fans Willis will still have a large role in the film.

“I don’t know how you do Die Hard without Bruce,” di Bonaventura said. “The idea that he’s not very significant in this movie is not accurate at all. We are gonna explore John McClane in his twenties. But just as prominent is the 60-year-old version.”

Len Wiseman (Live Free or Die Hard) will direct and produce "McClane," which doesn't have a release date yet.

The Conjuring writers Chad and Carey Hayes are penning the latest version of the script.
