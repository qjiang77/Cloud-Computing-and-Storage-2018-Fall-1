2K Games has announced that Sid Meier's Civilization 6 will be heading to Nintendo Switch this November.

Sid Meier's Civilization 6 is dropping for the Switch on November 16. 2K announced the news on the game's official site, saying that the console title will include all of the latest updates and improvements, as well as four extra content packs including Vikings, Poland, Austrailia, and Persian and Macedon Civilization and Scenario packs.

The game launched on iPad at the end of last year, and the Rise and Fall expansion was released back in February.

The Switch version of the game will feature four player local co-op and competitive multiplayer.

No doubt we'll get more details during the Nintendo Direct that was initially scheduled for this week, but has been pushed back due to the earthquake in Hokkaido, Japan.
