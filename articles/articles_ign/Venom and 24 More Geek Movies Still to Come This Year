The Nun

Exit Theatre Mode

Release date: Sep. 7 (US/UK), Sep. 6 (AU)

The Conjuring franchise is expanding again with this latest spinoff prequel. The Nun flashes back to 1950's Romania and focuses on the demon Valek, last seen tormenting Vera Farmiga's Lorraine Warren in The Conjuring 2. This film stars Farmiga's sister Taissa as Sister Irene and Demián Bichir as Father Burke, a Catholic priest sent to investigate a mysterious suicide. While James Wan remains attached as a producer, this particular spinoff is directed by The Hallow's Corin Hardy.

Mandy

Exit Theatre Mode

Release date: Sep. 14 (US), Oct. 12 (UK), Sep. 21 (AU)

It's not often that you see phrases like "critically acclaimed" and "new Nicolas Cage movie" popping up in the same sentence, but that's why we're so excited to see Mandy hitting wide release. This new action horror film was the toast of this year's Sundance Film Festival, with critics praising both director Panos Cosmatos' '80s-influenced sense of style and Cage's deranged performance as a mountain man fighting to rescue his wife from a deadly cult. On top of everything else, this film features one of the last film scores composed by the late Jóhann Jóhannsson.

The Predator

Exit Theatre Mode

Release date: Sep. 14 (US), Sep. 12 (UK), Sep. 13 (AU)

While 1987's Predator is almost universally beloved, few would argue that any of the sequels or spinoffs hold a candle to the original. We'll soon learn if director/co-writer Shane Black can succeed where others have failed. This installment features different classes of Predator, such as the more powerful Ultimate Predator. The film's cast of hapless humans includes Olivia Munn, Boyd Holbrook, Keegan-Michael Key Jacob Tremblay, and Trevante Rhodes.

The House With A Clock In Its Walls

Exit Theatre Mode

Release date: Sep. 21 (US/UK), Sep. 20 (AU)

Director Eli Roth is generally known for helming gory horror movies like Cabin Fever and Hostel, which makes this family-friendly fantasy film a very interesting career choice. Based on the novel by John Bellairs and Edward Gorey, the film revolves around a ten-year-old boy named Lewis (Owen Vaccaro) who moves in with his uncle Jonathan (Jack Black), a warlock whose house has the power to end the world. The cast also includes Cate Blanchett, Kyle MacLachlan and Renée Elise Goldsberry.

Venom

Exit Theatre Mode

Release date: Oct. 5 (US/UK), Oct. 4 (AU)

Sony's new universe of Marvel Characters officially kicks off with the release of Venom. Tom Hardy stars as both struggling journalist Eddie Brock and his symbiote alter ego. The film also features Michelle Williams as Anne Weying and Riz Ahmed as Carlton Drake. There's a lot riding on this particular Marvel movie. It has to prove that there's room for another shared Marvel Universe on the big screen, and that Sony can establish a new Spider-Man franchise that features little or no involvement from Spider-Man himself. Here's hoping Venom is up to the challenge.

Bad Times at the El Royale

Exit Theatre Mode

Release date: Oct. 5 (US), Oct. 12 (UK), Oct. 11 (AU)

Writer/director Drew Goddard returns with a new movie that looks and sounds positively Tarantino-esque. Bad Times at the El Royale revolves around seven strangers who are brought together by fate at an abandoned hotel. The story unfolds over the course of a single evening, as dark secrets are revealed and each of these seven characters is given a chance at redemption. The eclectic cast includes Chris Hemsworth, Dakota Johnson, Cynthia Erivo, Jon Hamm and Jeff Bridges.

Apostle

Release date: Oct. 12 (global debut, exclusively on Netflix)

Netflix is adding plenty of intriguing new films to its lineup this fall, but none stand out more than this period horror movie. For one thing, it features The Raid director Gareth Evans diving into a whole new genre. Dan Stevens stars as Thomas Richardson, a man who travels to an island to rescue his sister (Lucy Boynton) from the clutches of an evil cult.

First Man

Exit Theatre Mode

Release date: Oct. 12 (US/UK), Oct. 11 (AU)

For La La Land fans, the news that director Damien Chazelle and star Ryan Gosling are reuniting on a new project should be reason enough to dash to the theater. But even if those two weren't already a proven combo, the subject matter is enough to make this biopic stand out. Gosling stars as famed astronaut Neil Armstrong, with the film tracing the dangerous mission that resulted in him becoming the first man to walk on the moon. The cast also includes Claire Foy, Pablo Schreiber, Kyle Chandler and Corey Stoll.

Goosebumps 2: Haunted Halloween

Exit Theatre Mode

Release date: Oct. 12 (US/UK), Oct. 25 (AU)

2015's Goosebumps proved to be a surprisingly enjoyable take on the popular line of kid-friendly horror books, so a sequel is definitely welcome. Whether Goosebumps 2 can retain the magic of the original without the same cast or director remains to be seen, however. This time around, a group of kids stumble across a manuscript in the ruins of R.L. Stine's mansion, accidentally unleashing Slappy the Dummy and his plans for a horror apocalypse upon the world. The cast includes Wendi McLendon-Covey, Madison Iseman, Jeremy Ray Taylor, Caleel Harris, Chris Parnell, and Ken Jeong.

Halloween

Exit Theatre Mode

Release date: Oct. 19 (US/UK), Oct. 25 (AU)

At this point, the Halloween franchise is second to none when it comes to convoluted and confusing movie continuity. The latest entry in the series isn't a reboot, but rather a sequel that ignores everything that came after the 1978 original. It chronicles the final confrontation between Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) and the unstoppable mass murderer known as Michael Myers. The fact that the film is directed by indie darling David Gordon Green gives us even more hope that this movie will turn out to be the only Halloween sequel anyone ever needs.

Suspiria

Exit Theatre Mode

Release date: Oct. 26 (US, limited), Nov. 2 (US wide), Nov. 16 (UK), Nov. 8 (AU)

The original Suspiria is one of the more controversial and divisive horror films of all time, though pretty much everyone agreed it looked fantastic. We'll see if this remake can achieve similar notoriety. The fact that it's the next project from Call Me By Your Name director Luca Guadagnino makes this project all the more intriguing. Dakota Johnson stars as an elite ballerina who joins a twisted academy run by Tilda Swinton's Madame Blanc.

Dr. Seuss' The Grinch

Exit Theatre Mode

Release date: Nov. 9 (US/UK), Nov. 29 (AU)

The classic Dr. Seuss book is getting the filmed treatment for a third time. In this case, animation giant Illumination is taking a crack at the timeless story of a grump with an undersized heart who tries to ruin Christmas for the residents of Whoville. It remains to be seen if this remake can carve out a place for itself alongside the 1966 TV special or the 2000 live-action movie, but casting Benedict Cumberbatch as the voice of the Grinch is certainly a start.

The Girl in the Spider's Web

Exit Theatre Mode

Release date: Nov. 9 (US/UK), Nov. 8 (AU)

2011's The Girl With a Dragon Tattoo failed to spawn a franchise, much to the chagrin of fans of Stieg Larsson's popular crime thriller novels. The good news is that the series is returning to the big screen, albeit with a new cast and director. This film is based on the fourth novel in the series, which also happens to be the first not written by Larsson himself. The Crown's Claire Foy is taking over the role of eccentric hacker Lisbeth Salander, while Sverrir Gudnason plays her partner, investigative journalist Mikael Blomkvist.

Overlord

Exit Theatre Mode

Release date: Nov. 9 (US), Nov. 7 (UK), Nov. 8 (AU)

The flow of horror movies isn't stopping after Halloween this year. Overlord, which is produced by J.J. Abrams, follows a group of WWII troops caught behind enemy lines. As they fight to return home, they encounter a series of deadly creatures created by sadistic Nazi scientists. Jovan Adepo, Wyatt Russell, Jacob Anderson, Pilou Asbæk and Iain De Caestecker are among the cast.

Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald

Exit Theatre Mode

Release date: Nov. 16 (US/UK), Nov. 15 (AU)

Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald is the second in a planned series of five Harry Potter prequels. This time around, eccentric magician Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) is called back into action by none other than Albus Dumbledore (Jude Law) to help deal with the growing threat posed by dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald (Johnny Depp). Expect plenty of hijinks involving magical creatures, like last time, but it appears that this sequel will more directly tie into the Harry Potter mythology fans know and love.

Creed II

Exit Theatre Mode

Release date: Nov. 21 (US), Nov. 30 (UK), Nov. 29 (AU)

Creed successfully reinvigorated the Rocky franchise in 2015, with many declaring it the best since the 1976 original. For an encore, the series is now pitting Michael B. Jordan's Adonis Creed against Viktor Drago (Florian Munteanu), the son of Ivan Drago himself. With both Sylvester Stallone and Dolph Lundgren reprising their iconic roles, expect a real clash of generations in this boxing epic. The big question is whether director Stephen Caple, Jr. can recapture the magic Ryan Coogler brought to the first Creed.

Ralph Breaks the Internet

Exit Theatre Mode

Release date: Nov. 21 (US), Nov. 30 (UK), Dec. 26 (AU)

Disney's popular 2012 animated film Wreck-It Ralph is getting a sequel, with John C. Reilly and Sarah Silverman reprising their roles as Ralph and Vanellope, respectively. As the two heroes journey across the Internet to save the Sugar Rush arcade game from destruction, they'll bump into a who's who cast of Disney, Marvel and Star Wars icons. Basically, Ralph Breaks the Internet is the Disney princess team-up movie we've all been waiting for.

Robin Hood

Exit Theatre Mode

Release date: Nov. 21 (US/UK), Nov. 22 (AU)

It's pretty much an unwritten law that Hollywood can only go so long without delivering a new take on the classic Robin Hood story. This version seeks to carve a place for itself on the strength of its stylish action scenes and an impressive cast. Kingsman's Taron Egerton stars as the legendary archer hero, with Jamie Foxx playing Little John and Ben Mendelsohn playing the Sheriff of Nottingham.

Pokémon the Movie: The Power of Us

Release date: Nov. 24 (US), Unknown (UK/AU)

2017's Pokémon the Movie: I Choose You! rebooted the long-running anime series and the story of aspiring Pokemon master Ash Ketchum. The Power of Us is a continuation of that new story. This time around, Ash heads to Fura City just in time for the Wind Festival, an annual celebration where people gather to be blessed by the Legendary Pokémon Lugia. Expect a new cast of friends and enemies as Ash confronts his latest Pokémon-related mystery.

Mortal Engines

Exit Theatre Mode

Release date: Dec. 14 (US/UK), Dec. 26 (AU)

This post-apocalyptic sci-fi film is basically a mini-Lord of the Rings reunion. Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh and Phillipa Boyens all penned the screenplay, with Jackson's frequent storyboard artist Christian Rivers stepping into the director's chair. Mortal Engines showcases a steampunk-influenced world where the few remaining cities have become mobile engines of destruction, roaming the wastelands and devouring smaller cities for resources. LotR vet Hugo Weaving stars alongside Hera Hilmar, Robert Sheehan, Jihae and Ronan Raftery.

Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse

Exit Theatre Mode

Release date: Dec. 14 (US/UK), Dec. 13 (AU)

There's another Spider-Man movie hitting theaters this fall with no ties to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Into the Spider-Verse is a CG-animated film directed by Bob Persichetti, Peter Ramsey and Rodney Rothman and featuring a screenplay from The LEGO Movie's Phil Lord. This particular Spider-Man adventure delves into the concept of the multiverse, as young, up-and-coming hero Miles Morales (Shameik Moore) joins forces with Peter Parker (Jake Johnson) and Gwen Stacy (Hailee Steinfeld). Nic Cage will even stop by to voice Spider-Man Noir, making this his second animated superhero movie of 2018 (after Teen Titans GO! To the Movies).

Mary Poppins Returns

Exit Theatre Mode

Release date: Dec. 19 (US), Dec. 21 (UK), Jan. 1 (AU)

Director Rob Marshall faces the unenviable task of delivering a sequel to one of the most beloved Disney movies of all time. Mary Poppins Returns takes place 25 years after the original, with the grown-up Banks children again needing the assistance of the supernaturally helpful Mary (Emily Blunt). Joining her are lamplighter Jack (Lin-Manuel Miranda) and Mary's unusual cousin Topsy (Meryl Streep). This sequel will also be a musical, which makes Hamilton creator Miranda's involvement that much more exciting.

Aquaman

Exit Theatre Mode

Release date: Dec. 21 (US), Dec. 14 (UK), Dec. 13 (AU)

It's been a fairly quiet year in terms of DC movies, but 2018 will wrap up with the latest addition to the DC movie universe. Aquaman puts the spotlight on Arthur Curry (Jason Momoa) as he finally embraces his Atlantean royal heritage and joins forces with Mera (Amber Heard) to save his kingdom. Standing in their way will be Prince Orm (Patrick Wilson) and Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II). If director James Wan can replicate the same magic he brought to franchises like The Conjuring and The Fast and the Furious, this film could mark a major shift in DC's cinematic fortunes.

Bumblebee

Exit Theatre Mode

Release date: Dec. 21 (US), Dec. 26 (UK/AU)

While technically a prequel to Michael Bay's Transformers series, Bumblebee also marks a fresh start for the lucrative but critically panned franchise. Bumblebee takes place in 1987 and pairs the titular Cybertronian hero with a new human ally (Hailee Steinfeld) as they battle the Decepticons and a ruthless organization known as Sector 7. Laika fans will be happy to know that Kubo and the Two Strings director Travis Knight directed this prequel, with the end product hopefully sticking a little closer to the style of the original animated series.

Alita: Battle Angel

Exit Theatre Mode

Release date: Dec. 21 (US), Dec. 26 (UK)

Hollywood has a poor track record with adapting popular anime and manga franchises. It remains to be seen whether director Robert Rodriguez and producer James Cameron can succeed where others have failed, but we're optimistic. Rosa Salazar stars as Alita, a cybernetic woman whose very existence sparks a new war between man and machine in a cyberpunk future. The impressive cast also includes Cristoph Waltz, Mahershala Ali, and Jennifer Connelly. The real question is whether that cast and the source material are enough to help this film stand out on what may well be the most crowded movie weekend of the whole year.
