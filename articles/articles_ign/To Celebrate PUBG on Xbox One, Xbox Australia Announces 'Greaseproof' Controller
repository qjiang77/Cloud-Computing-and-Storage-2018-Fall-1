To celebrate the graduation of PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds from Xbox Game Preview to full game, Xbox has announced a limited edition 'greaseproof' controller in Australia.

In a bit of marketing genius that follows in the footsteps of the...er, 'Xbox Onesie', the controller sports a "patented coating" of hand sprayed urethane (per the press release) that is resistant to grease...namely, chicken grease, from your hard-won chicken dinners.

There are currently only 200 of these controllers in existence, and as of now, they seem to be only available in Australia (Xbox Australia is giving away 10 via its Facebook page.) You can check out the controller getting a greasy shower in the video below.

If you're not Australia-based, don't fret - you can always preorder the official - and presumably less limited - PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds Xbox One Wireless controller that's hitting shelves October 30.

PUBG 1.0 is out on Xbox One now and sees the addition of War Mode, a team deathmatch mode complete with respawns and teammate reviving, where teams compete to reach a score goal, and The Sanhok map.
