Brooklyn Nine-Nine, the acclaimed cop-comedy led by Andy Samberg, is getting five extra episodes for its upcoming sixth season, pushing the total episode count from 13 to 18.

As reported by Deadline, the show will premiere mid-season during the 2018-2019 television season, meaning it will likely come in early 2019. Past seasons of Brooklyn Nine-Nine were typically 22 or more episodes long, though this boost from NBC appears to be a vote of confidence in the show.

The boost in episode order comes after NBC saved the show from cancelation last May following five seasons at Fox. This revival of the show came just one day after Fox decided to cancel Brooklyn Nine-Nine, and now it appears the comedy will get another chance to thrive at NBC with this bolstered order.

Brooklyn Nine-Nine has received critical acclaim during its last five seasons, including multiple Golden Globe awards.
