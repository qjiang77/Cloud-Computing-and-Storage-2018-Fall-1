Walmart has a robust selection of prebuilt gaming PCs, and many of them are on sale right now. Don't wait for the new RTX 2080 benchmarks if you're thinking of jumping, head-first, into the world of PC gaming. You can get a perfectly competent gaming PC right now, on that runs basically every modern game, for around the same price as a new 20-series card alone.

iBUYPOWER WA8400i

iBUYPOWER WA8400i for $1599

Here's what you get with this PC: an Intel i7-8700K processor with 16GB DDR4 memory, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 8GB graphics card and a whopping 3TB HDD. Plus it looks pretty ferocious, too.

CYBERPOWERPC Gamer Supreme Liquid Cool SLC8802OPT

CYBERPOWERPC SLC8802OPT for $1329

This might be the best value for a powerful PC right now. Inside this beast lurks an Intel i7 8700K CPU and AMD Radeon RX 580 8GB GPU. There are a lot of advantages to an Radeon GPU, first and foremost being the savings you can enjoy on FreeSync-enabled displays. But wait, there's more: this PC has a staggering 32GB of RAM and a generous 32GB of Intel Optane memory to help speed up the 3TB HDD inside. All of that for $1329, I mean, come on now.

CYBERPOWERPC Gamer Xtreme Liquid Cool GLC5002OPT

CYBERPOWERPC GLC5002OPT for $1149

On top of an Intel i7 8700K CPU and Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 6GB GPU, this PC has 16GB RAM and 16GB Intel Optane Memory. That Optane memory makes the spacious 2TB HDD act like an SSD. That's a good thing.

CYBERPOWERPC Gamer Xtreme Liquid Cool GLC5200CPG

CYBERPOWERPC GLC5200CPG for $1059

Here's another one with multi-color LEDs, a crucial part of any gaming PC. Oh, it also has an Intel i7-8700K CPU and AMD Radeon RX 580 4GB GPU, 16GB RAM and a 120GB SSD for your OS and 1TB HDD for everything else. But the LEDs are chef-kiss level.

iBUYPOWER Black Panther

iBUYPOWER Black Panther for $779.99

The AMD FX-8320 processor and GTX 1050Ti 4GB inside the iBUYPOWER Black Panther is plenty of power for gaming, helped along by 16GB RAM. There's also a 2TB HDD, which is good amount of HDD, in my opinion.

CYBERPOWERPC BattleBox Essential GXi10900CPG

CYBERPOWERPC BattleBox for $899

The Intel i5-8600K processor, 8GB RAM, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 3GB, and 120GB SSD and 2TB HDD is a great deal for the price, but the best thing about this PC is the LED lighting. How will people know your PC is for gaming if it doesn't have LED lighting?

Acer Aspire GX-785

Acer Aspire GX-785 for $629.99

This is one of the biggest discounts on a PC on Walmart's website right now. It's marked down $370 from its regular price, and has an Intel i5-7400 processor with 8GB DDR4 RAM and an AMD Radeon RX 480 GPU. It also includes a 1TB HDD, so you can cram a ton of games on there.
