Today Samsung officially unveiled its updated Galaxy Note 9 smartphone, and in addition to bumps to the phone's specs it also announced the insanely popular game Fortnite is coming to Android exclusively on Galaxy devices, though only for 48 hours before it goes on sale on Epic's website for other Android users. Samsung held a special launch event in New York City to reveal the news.

Fortnite for Android Is Coming Exclusively to Galaxy Devices (For Now)

The world's most popular game is coming to Android with a timed launch alongside the new Galaxy Note 9, though it's available on all recent Galaxy devices as well. If you pre-order the phone before August 23rd you can get a custom skin named Galaxy along with 15,000 V-Bucks (or choose a pair of AKG noise-cancelling headphones) for free, or you can get both the skin and the headphones for $99. After the exclusive window has closed in 48 hours, Android phone owners will be able to download the game on Epic's website.

Specs: Camera, Storage, and the Processor Powering the Note 9

Samsung's new phone isn't particularly different than the Galaxy Note 8 at first blush. Both look extremely similar, but inside Samsung has added a few upgrades from the previous model. Powering the Galaxy Note 9 is an upgraded Snapdragon 845 8-core CPU, which supports higher video playback frame rates than the Snapdragon 835 powering the Note 8. It also supports BT.2020 and HLG dynamic-range standards in addition to the HDR10 support already seen on the Note 8. Samsung says the phone's horsepower is a good match for gaming thanks to a water/carbon fiber cooling system and an "AI-based algorithm" that adjusts the phone's performance automatically.

The cameras are 12MP in the back with dual apertures, and 8MP in the front, with essentially the same specifications as the camera on the previous model, as well as the Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9+.

The battery in the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 is a whopping 4,000mAh, up from 3,300 in the previous model, which should allow for all-day use. It accepts microSD cards up to 512GB, which will help accommodate the 4K 60fps video the Samsung Galaxy Note 9. Storage options include 128GB and 512GB, making 1TB of combined storage possible for the first time thanks to the SD card reader. Like the Note 8, the 128GB model Galaxy Note 9 has 6GB of RAM, but the 512GB model sports an extra two gigs, for a total of 8GB.

On the outside, the Galaxy Note 9 doesn't look too different from the Note 8. The display is .1 inches bigger, measuring 6.4" instead of 6.3" on the previous model. The Super AMOLED display has a QHD+ resolution of 2960 x 1440 (default resolution is Full HD+ and can be changed to Quad HD+ in settings). Overall, the Galaxy Note 9 is a little thicker than its predecessor, but also a bit shorter, coming in at 161.9 x 76.3 x 8.8 mm.

An Improved S-Pen

The Samsung S-pen for the Galaxy Note 9 has a few upgrades over earlier versions. More than just a stylus, the S-pen now acts as a remote control thanks to the addition of Bluetooth LE, allowing you to adjust features like volume, use it as a remote camera shutter, and even to control slide presentations. Samsung says the S-Pen can be charged in the phone in just a minute.
