Predicting the Top 10 Fall Box Office Movies|http://www.ign.com/movies|https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/09/04/predicting-the-top-10-fall-box-office-movies-venom-aquaman-disney||2018-09-04|||Share. Venom and Aquaman and Grindelwald, Oh My! Venom and Aquaman and Grindelwald, Oh My!

Now that the summer movie season has come to a close, it’s time to look ahead to see what the fall movies have to offer. While the fall movies don’t often put up as big of numbers as their summer counterparts, there are a number of potential blockbusters waiting in the wings, but for the first time in four years, there won’t be a Star Wars movie at the end of the year, which opens up the field considerably. The end of the year is shaping up to be quite competitive though, which could leave a number of high profile releases lost in the shuffle.

While there is only one wide release opening on Christmas Day (Focus Features’ On the Basis of Sex), there are five major releases on December 21 (Alita: Battle Angel, Aquaman, Bumblebee, Holmes & Watson, and Welcome to Marwen), plus Mary Poppins Returns on December 19. This is almost exactly identical to last year’s holiday release schedule which saw the release of five new films (Downsizing, Father Figures, Pitch Perfect 3, The Greatest Showman and Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle) in the days before Christmas. Jumanji ($404.5 million) was the only bona fide hit of the five, although The Greatest Showman ($174.3 million) and Pitch Perfect 3 ($104.9 million) also fared well.

This fall, at first glance, there doesn’t appear to be anything that has the capability of hitting $400 million domestic, or even $300 million domestic, and there will likely be a lot of high-profile releases that simply won’t perform. Among these, we’re predicting, are Disney’s Nutcracker and the Four Realms ($28.4 million debut, $140.7 million domestic), 20th Century Fox’s Bohemian Rhapsody ($24.2 million debut, $130.1 million domestic) and Holmes and Watson ($19.1 million domestic, $101.9 million domestic).

There is also a crowded Thanksgiving weekend with five new releases including Creed 2 ($27.8 million debut, $136.8 million domestic), Robin Hood ($18.7 million debut, $98.2 million domestic), Green Book ($8.6 million debut, $41.6 million domestic) and Second Act ($5.2 million debut, $25.6 million domestic), all of which will likely fall to one of the top 10 picks, Ralph Breaks the Internet: Wreck-It Ralph 2.

With all of that being said, predicting box office debuts and domestic tallies is far from an exact science, and there is no guarantee that any of the movies below, or above, will even be released on their current dates, or this fall at all. The following predictions are based on a number of factors, including release date, amount of competition on said release date and the box office performance of previous movies. While those all play a factor in each projection, it’s largely based on just pure gut instinct.

Studios have often yanked movies from their established releases, sometimes even weeks before their debut, so nothing is certainly set in stone at this point. But, if everything does stay the same, with no major release shuffles, here are the picks for the top 10 movies to be released in September, through December.

10) Mary Poppins Returns - December 19

Exit Theatre Mode

Disney has had a lot of success with their remakes of beloved classics lately, such as The Jungle Book ($364 million domestic), but not all of their remakes are massive hits, such as Pete’s Dragon ($76.2 million domestic). Mary Poppins Returns will likely find some middle ground between the two, but given it’s one of six new wide releases hitting theaters in the week before Christmas Day, it may suffer in such a crowded frame. Then again, it is essentially the only family-friendly movie to hit theaters over the Christmas holiday, providing some wholesome counter-programming against big-budget tentpoles like Bumblebee and Aquaman, but we still don’t see it becoming a breakout hit, by any means. $29.7 million debut, $148.6 million domestic

9) The Predator - September 14

Exit Theatre Mode

The Predator franchise hasn’t exactly been the most lucrative at the box office, but director Shane Black’s version could put this alien killer back on the map with a strong box office performance. While it does open in quite the crowded frame with three more movies debuting in wide release (White Boy Rick, A Simple Favor, Unbroken: Path to Redemption), none of those will offer too much competition. The five previous movies combined (Predator, Predator 2, Alien vs. Predator, Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem, Predators) have only earned $264.5 million combined, but with a brand new cast (and a massive Ultimate Predator to boot), this could make some waves next weekend. $32.7 million debut, $157.3 million domestic

8) The Grinch - November 9

Exit Theatre Mode

Family-friendly animated movies used to be seen as guaranteed hits, since they’re among the few genres where an entire family can go to the theater together. While there are still plenty of animated blockbusters like The Incredibles 2, which just passed $600 million domestic, the genre as a whole seems to have lost a bit of its luster, and this year may be the first since 1997 where there hasn’t been an animated movie in the yearly box office top 10. Dr. Seuss' The Grinch will probably represent the genre’s best chance at cracking the top 10, if it performs much better than this projection, but that remains to be seen. It will also open against The Girl in the Spider’s Web and Overlord on November 9, with seven new wide releases opening between them and Thanksgiving, so it may have its work cut out for it. $39.4 million debut, $183.9 million domestic

7) Halloween - October 19

Exit Theatre Mode

For the past few years, the third frame in October has become quite crowded, with last year seeing five new movies opening in wide release, but this year there are only three, lead by Universal’s highly-anticipated Halloween. While there’s no way of knowing for sure, it’s possible that Michael Myers was able to scare away some of the competition, especially since it doesn’t have a ton of viable competition. It will go up against The Hate U Give and Serenity on opening weekend, and Hunter Killer, Indivisible and Johnny English Strikes Again on October 26, so it could easily clean up on those two weekends. If it does hit this projection, it will be the biggest debut and domestic tally in the franchise’s history. $43.6 million debut, $198.4 million domestic

6) Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse - December 14

Exit Theatre Mode

Sony expands their Spidey franchise with Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, which should have a strong debut going up against Mortal Engines on December 14 (which we can’t see cracking the fall top 10). While Sony (and Marvel) have finally found a live-action Spider-Man (Tom Holland) that can draw in an audience, Sony is expanding their Spidey reach with this animated adventure that focuses on a young Miles Morales (voiced by Shameik Moore). While it may have trouble maintaining an audience after its debut, amid the crowded Christmas frame, it should fare quite well, especially since it’s the only animated movie released in December. $48.7 million debut, $206.4 million domestic

5) Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald - November 16

Exit Theatre Mode

The projection for this sequel does represent a significant drop from 2016’s Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them ($74.4 million debut, $234 million domestic), but it still proves there’s an audience for even a tertiary segment of the ever-massive Harry Potter universe. The casting of Johnny Depp as the dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald has come under fire, after abuse allegations have surfaced against the actor, which could also have an impact on its box office performance. With not much competition (Instant Family, Widows) at the box office in its mid-November frame, Fantastic Beasts 2 should provide Warner Bros. with a modest success. $53.5 million debut, $215.9 million domestic

4) Ralph Breaks the Internet: Wreck-It Ralph 2 - November 21

Exit Theatre Mode

2012’s Wreck-It Ralph was one of 2012’s surprise hits, taking in $189.4 million domestic, and the sequel should have no trouble surpassing its predecessor. The animated sequel has already been making headlines for bringing together all of Disney’s animated princesses under one cinematic roof, with Vanellope Von Schweetz (Sarah Silverman) being the latest addition to the long line of Disney princesses. Wreck-It Ralph 2 should easily win the crowded Thanksgiving frame this year, and it may even take the top spot for three weekends in a row, if it doesn’t drop too much in its second and third frames. $58.6 million debut, $240.7 million domestic

3) Bumblebee - December 21

Exit Theatre Mode

After five massive movies, Paramount is now spinning off its Transformers franchise, focusing on the beloved Bumblebee character with a 1980s-set spin-off that provides an origin story for this robot in disguise. Given that last year’s Transformers: The Last Knight slipped to a franchise low ($44.7 million debut, $130.2 million domestic), this spin-off couldn’t have come at a better time to revitalize the franchise. This is also the first project to come out of the infamous Transformers writer’s room, with a new writer (Christina Hodson) and director (Travis Knight) taking the reins from longtime Transformers Michael Bay, with numerous spin-offs in the works. If Bumblebee hits big, it will be interesting to see how Paramount moves forward with this franchise. $60.3 million debut, $238.9 million domestic

2) Venom - October 5

Exit Theatre Mode

Along with Sony’s animated Spider-Verse, the studio is expanding its live-action Spidey franchise as well with Venom, the first of many planned live-action spin-offs that include Morbius, Kraven, and Silk. While there have been conflicting rumors about whether or not Tom Holland himself will be surfacing in this spin-off as Peter Parker/Spider-Man, Sony will be building around Spidey with a cinematic universe of their own, starting with Venom. There has been quite a great deal of buzz swirling around the trailers for Venom, and it should be able to easily win two weekends in a row, before being dethroned by Halloween on October 19. $65.8 million debut, $257.4 million domestic

1) Aquaman - December 21

Exit Theatre Mode

While the DCEU hasn’t performed at the box office on nearly the same level as its Marvel Studios counterparts, there is an audience for the DCEU heroes, as proven by the standalone success of Wonder Woman ($103.2 million debut, $412.6 million domestic). While the inter-connected DCEU may be in serious disarray, the characters themselves still have more value than the sum of its parts, which is why Aquaman will likely perform quite well for Warner Bros. Aquaman still doesn’t have as much name recognition as most of the other DCEU heroes, but Jason Momoa and company should still deliver a strong hit that could just put the DCEU back on the right track. $92.6 million debut, $296.4 million domestic
