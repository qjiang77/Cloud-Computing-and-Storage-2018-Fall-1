The Happytime Murders aims to be the raunchiest -- and we will see once the film opens August 24th if it's also the funniest -- puppet movie since Team America: World Police. The film stars Melissa McCarthy as a human cop who's partnered with a puppet cop to investigate the murders of former cast members of The Happytime Gang, a long-cancelled show in the vein of The Muppets.

The movie's distributor, STXfilms, teamed with marketing agency Giant Spoon and Henson Alternative to create a pop-up activation in Hollywood called The InkHole. It's meant to be a seedy tattoo parlor with a secret speakeasy inside where puppets and humans take a walk on the wild side.

The InkHole is open to members of the public (21 and over) from August 10th-13th and is located at 1723 N. Hudson Ave, Hollywood, CA 90028.

IGN was among the media outlets invited to visit The InkHole, where puppeteers performed bawdy songs, comedy routines, stripteases, and ran gambling tables alongside human actors and animatronics.

There were the Rotton Cotton Girls and the covert Sugar Den, while word had it that "undercover cops" in the partiers' midst were on the prowl for the murder suspects. There were even puppet porn videos lining the walls of a shop within The InkHole.
