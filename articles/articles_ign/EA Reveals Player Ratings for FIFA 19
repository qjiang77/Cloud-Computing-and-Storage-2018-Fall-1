EA Reveals Player Ratings for FIFA 19|http://www.ign.com/nintendo|https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/09/07/ea-reveals-player-ratings-for-fifa-19||2018-09-07|||Share. Who will get the top spot? Who will get the top spot?

EA has begun counting down the top 100 players in FIFA 19, and #FIFARatings has gotten fans debating which players deserve the top spots.

The player ratings are being officially revealed by EA in increments of 20, and will likely all be released by the time the game hits store shelves worldwide on September 28 - as of now, the 100-61 spots have been unveiled. As with last yearâ€™s FIFA 18 ratings, the stats and rankings are based on player performances from the past year of football.

Top players from FIFA 18 included FIFA 18 (and FIFA 19) cover athlete Cristiano Ronaldo in the top spot, Lionel Messi grabbing second and Neymar Jr. coming in third - both Neymar and Ronaldo share the FIFA 19 cover on the Champions and Ultimate Editions of the game.

A new trailer featuring various FIFA players across the world vying for top positions in the FIFA ratings has dropped along with the countdown reveal. Players featured in the trailer include Cristiano Ronaldo, Neymar Jr, Kevin De Bruyne and more.
