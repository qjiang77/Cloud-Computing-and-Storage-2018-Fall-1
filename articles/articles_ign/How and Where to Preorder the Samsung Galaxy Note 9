Samsung introduced the Galaxy Note 9 smartphone yesterday, showing off the new and improved features of its next iteration of its Note line. The Samsung Galaxy Note 9 release date is August 24, and it comes in either a 128GB model with 6GB of RAM, or a 512GB model with 8GB of RAM.

Performance and Improvements

Inside the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 is an upgraded Snapdragon 845 8-core CPU, and has a water/carbon fiber cooling system and "AI-based algorithm" for on-the-fly performance adjustments, something Samsung says works to improve performance in gaming.

Samsung also updated the S-pen, giving it the ability to work as a Bluetooth remote for certain applications. You can use it as a remote camera shutter, to control presentations, and adjust the volume in addition to using it as a stylus.

During the Note 9 event, Samsung announced owners of its smartphones would be among the first to get access to the Fortnite on Android beta. Preordering the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 gets you some special Fortnite bonuses to celebrate: you can get an astonishing 15,000 V-Bucks, or you can opt for a pair of AKG noise-cancelling headphones, for free with your preorder. For $99 extra, you can get both the V-bucks and the headphones.
