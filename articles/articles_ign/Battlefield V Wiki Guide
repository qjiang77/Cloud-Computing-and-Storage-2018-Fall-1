This page is current as of the Open Beta, and will be updated once the final game releases.

Skill trees is a blanket term for both weapon upgrades and vehicle specializations. Each skill tree is broken into three paths: left, right, and center. When upgrading a weapon or specializing a vehicle, you'll need to select one upgrade path to go down. Once you've selected an upgrade, you are locked into its path and cannot change this currently, so choose wisely! These pages will list which upgrades are on which paths.

Each primary weapon has its own set of upgrades and customizations. For info on each weapon's skill tree, click its name below. This list is separated by character class.
