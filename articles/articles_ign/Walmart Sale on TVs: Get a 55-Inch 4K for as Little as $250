Labor Day is behind us, and while the weather might still be nice, it's getting ready to turn, forcing us indoors. What a perfect time for a new television set! There's also the little matter of all the great, AAA-games coming out between now and the holiday break. Don't you think you owe it to yourself to experience Spider-Man on PS4 Pro on a bright, big new 4K television?

Walmart once again comes through in the clutch, with a bunch of surprisingly good clearance TVs in various sizes. They range from entry-level to upper-middle-end, and for the prices they're being offered at, they're pretty excellent.

Vizio D65-F1 65-inch 4K TV for $698

Vizio D65-F1 65-inch 4K TV

Free freight shipping on a huge, 4K TV? Yeah, OK, that sounds amazing. Sign me up. But it gets better, because this is a Vizio, and I still have a very old Vizio 1080p set in my room and it works great all these years later. I trust you, Vizio.

Samsung 55-inch 6-Series 4K TV for $448

Samsung 55-inch 6-Series 4K TV

I've always been pleased with Samsung's televisions and computer displays, and while this isn't its top-end series, it's still a great set at a great size with a great price.

Sceptre 55-inch 4K TV for $249.99

Sceptre 55-inch 4K TV

Free 2-day shipping is the icing on the cake for this ultra-low priced, ultra-high def television set. This is the ideal set if you either want a second, but also very large, television, or if you just need a lot of screen but don't want to spend a lot of cash. Seriously, less than $300? That's pretty hard to resist.

Sceptre 75-inch 4K TV for $899.99

Sceptre 75-inch 4K TV

If you're looking for as much 4K screen as you can fit and still get it under a thousand bucks, this is a monster. I feel it's important to remind everyone just how enormous a 75-inch screen actually is: since 75 is the diagonal measurement, this television is 5 and a half feet wide. I know grown people who aren't that tall.

JVC 55-inch 4K TV for $279.99

JVC 55-inch 4K TV

Here's another rock-bottom price on a sizable television set with 4K resolution. Football season starts this week, so if you want a bigger television with 4K resolution, this is a fine, low-cost alternative to the Sceptre up there.

Sharp 50-inch 4K TV for $279.99

Sharp 50-inch 4K TV

The smallest television on this list is still under $300, still has 4K resolution, and has 3 HDMI ports and HDR. Let's be honest, 50 inches is probably more than enough unless you have a really big living room.
