Today's Newest Deals

This might just be the best Humble Monthly Bundle of the year. Overwatch was awarded IGN's Game of the Year back in 2016. It has never been priced this low, and the PC version to currently has the highest player count of all the platforms. Of course, that's not the only game you get for $12. You'll also get more game(s) to play about a month later when this bundle promotion ends, and these can be really good as well.

Note: Technically this is called a "subscription" but you can just buy this bundle without buying any subsequent ones.

Xbox Phantom Black Special Edition Wireless Controller Set at $59.99

This translucent and sleek new Xbox One controller is set to release this upcoming Tuesday but some online retailers are already providing a discount, in this case a cool $10 off. A few other Xbox One controllers are also on sale.

Nintendo Switch Pro Controller for $62.95

It's not often Nintendo products dip from their original retail price, but the Nintendo Switch Pro controller has a small discount on Amazon worth checking out. It may be a few months away, but it doesn't hurt to start stocking up on controllers before Super Smash Bros. Ultimate rolls around in December!

Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age for $15

This version of Final Fantasy XII features the Zodiac Job System for improved leveling along with enhanced visuals. If you didn't pick it up then, now is your chance!

The 2018 edition of the GoPro Hero Action Camera normally goes for $199 but this deal drops in a nice $30 gift card at Walmart.

Crazy deal! If you want a big TV without breaking your budget, here's a 55" 4K Smart-enabled HDTV for $300, plus you can extend the warranty to 3 years for a measly $26. To top it all off, you get free 2-day shipping.

For less than $500 you can score a 65" HDTV with 4K resolution and Smart capability. You also get free shipping on this deal and the option to extend to a 3 year warranty for only $54.

This is a flat out outstanding price for the best gaming phone on the market. The Razer Phone boasts a "razer" sharp 5.7" 1440x2560 display with 120Hz refresh rate and wide color gamut, THX certified Dolby Atmos powered dual front facing stereo speakers with 24-bit DAC, a capable Snapdragon 835 processor with 8GB of RAM, 64GB of storage, dual 12MP cameras, and a huge 4,000mAh battery.

Paying $1K for any fully warrantied pre-built gaming desktop equipped with a GeForce GTX 1080 would be a fabulous deal. Lucky for you, this is an Alienware Aurora, one of the highest end models in Dell's gaming lineup.

You can save an additional $40 by choosing the XPS chassis instead.

This is easily the lowest price out there for a GeForce GTX 1070 Ti (everyone else has it for well over $400). Not surprisingly, this card benches right in between the GeForce GTX 1070 and 1080. However, in many real world games, it performs just as well as the GTX 1080.

The Botvac D3 retails for $399.99 and it's currently sold for $300 or more elsewhere, including Amazon. Neato Botvacs are considered just as good (if not better) than comparable Roomba models and is a well known brand that is sold at Bed Bath & Beyond, Kohls, Best Buy, and more. This particular model features laser mapping, WiFi control via your smartphone app, and will automatically go back to the dock to charge.

These TVs come with a 90-day return policy, and since it is Walmart, you can always return the TV at a physical location if you need to. If you want to be extra safe, you can purchase an extended 3-year warranty plan for only $58. OLEDs are considered to be the king of HDTVs. They offer phenomenal contrast ratio, best-in-class black levels, and HDR.

This is the best price I've seen for a GTX 1060-equipped Alienware laptop. The GTX 1060 is more than capable of driving any game at this screen's 1080p native resolution, and it performs well on VR games for the Rift and Vive. Specs include a 15.6" 1080p IPS panel display, Intel Core i5-7300 quad-core processor, 8GB RAM, 1TB HDD, and GeForce GTX 1060 6GB video card.

Specs include a 15.6" 1080p IPS panel display, Intel Core i5-8300H 4-core processor, 8GB RAM, 1TB HDD, and GeForce GTX 1050 video card.

This model (MR6Y2LL/A) currently sells for $459 elsewhere, including the Apple St ore. The newest generation supports the Apple Pencil, much like the pricier iPad Pro.

For only $9.99 per course, you can train yourself in tools, software, and programming languages specific to the gaming industry. I and other people here have used Udemy and would easily recommend one of these hugely informative courses for the same cost as a Switch screen protector.
