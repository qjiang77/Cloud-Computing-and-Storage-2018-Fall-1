Amazon Hits $1 trillion in Market Value|http://www.ign.com/tech|https://www.ign.com/videos/2018/09/04/amazon-joins-the-1-trillion-market-value-club||2018-09-04|||Share. That’s a lot of Prime accounts. That’s a lot of Prime accounts.

Amazon has joined an extremely exclusive club of two publicly traded US companies that have reached the $1 trillion mark in market value.

As reported by CNBC, Amazon hit this market cap Tuesday morning after shares rose by almost two percent, making them worth $2,050.50. Because the outstanding share count was reportedly 487,741,189 shares, the math added up to the overall market value hitting that magical tredecuple digit number.

According to CNBC, analysts are citing an “ever-diversifying portfolio” from Amazon as an explanation for what drove the stock’s value upwards. A growth in Amazon Web Services is also noted as a major factor in the company’s recent success.

Though this is a major milestone for the company to hit, Apple managed to reach it a little over a month ago. Still, both US giants continue to grow in value and size.

Amazon has been making many headlines lately - both good and bad.

Though extremely popular with gamers, Amazon recently removed its 20 percent discount on pre-ordered video games. Amazon is also reportedly in talks with major film studios to make movies exclusively for its popular streaming service. It also looks like Amazon might have accidentally sold some pirated copies of games earlier this summer.
