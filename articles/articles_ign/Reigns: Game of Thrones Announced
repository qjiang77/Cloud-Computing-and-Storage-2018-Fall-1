Reigns, the royal adviser/strategy game, is officially getting a Game of Thrones version, coming to PC, iOS and Android devices in October 2018.

Announced through the official Reigns website, Reigns: Game of Thrones appears to operate much like Reigns and its sequel, Reigns: Her Majesty. The player assumes the position of a leader, in this case one of the various characters in Game of Thrones, as they make decisions based on what those around them advise.

Say Jon Snow is in charge: Sansa may ask for his help because the Iron Fleet is attacking the Wolfswood. Snow can either swipe right on this card and tell her she can have all the soldiers she needs, or reject her request. In Reigns, players must balance church, people, military and wealth with their decision making, careful not to allow any to become too weak or powerful. It appears Reigns: Game of Thrones uses a similar system.

The official synopsis reads: "Through the fiery visions of Melisandre, claim the Iron Throne as Cersei Lannister, Jon Snow, Daenerys Targaryen, and more to carefully navigate the complex relationships and hostile factions of the Seven Kingdoms."

Reigns: Game of Thrones is being developed by Nerial in partnership with HBO and will be published by Devolver Digital.

Reigns: Kings and Queens, a combination of Reigns and its sequel, is officially coming to the Nintendo Switch later this year. Devolver Digital had another psychotic Big Fancy Press Conference during E3 2018, where it announced My Friend Pedro for the Switch and PC.
