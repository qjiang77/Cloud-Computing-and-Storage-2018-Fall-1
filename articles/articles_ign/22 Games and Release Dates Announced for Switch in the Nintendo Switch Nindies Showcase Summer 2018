Nintendo streamed its Nintendo Switch Nindies Summer Showcase Summer 2018 and announced and discussed 22 games that will be released on the Switch this year and through early 2019, and we've made a rundown of each one.

This showcase is what Nintendo is calling a "part 2" to Nintendo UK's Indie Highlight video that released last week and focused on 16 other indie games that are headed to the Switch.
