# Documents for text data

1. This branch ('data') contains several folders of articles. Names of these folders show sources of the articles.

2. In each folder, there are hundreds of articles whose names are their titles.

3. In each article, the first line shows section names in this article which are separated by space.

   Following are corresponding values of the sections separated by English character '|' . 

   **Note**:

   (1) There may be empty strings in the following values. So there may be nothing between two  '|' s. 

   (2) Values may include multi-lines, like the value of section "text", which is content of the article.
