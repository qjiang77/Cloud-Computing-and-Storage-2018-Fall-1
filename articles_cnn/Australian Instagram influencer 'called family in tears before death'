Sinead McNamara "was crying and referring to an incident that took place onboard with another crew member," lawyer Haralambos Triandafylopoulos said in a statement.

The statement did not give any further details about the incident.

McNamara, 20, was found in a critical condition Friday on board the yacht docked in the port of Argostoli on the island of Kefalonia. She died while being airlifted to hospital. A coroner found that she had died by hanging.

Her family's lawyer said she was happy in the days before her death. "The parents also declare that Sinead did not have any problems, she was communicating with her family often and she was happy," the statement said. "In two days she was going to return to her family and friends in Australia. For the above reasons the family find it crucial that the conditions of her death be thoroughly investigated," the lawyer said.
