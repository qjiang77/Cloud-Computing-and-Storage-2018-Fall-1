Tech firms must do more to combat child sex abuse online, UK says|http://www.cnn.com/europe|http://www.cnn.com/2018/09/03/europe/uk-pedophile-online-intl/index.html||2018-09-03|Hilary Clarke||London (CNN) UK Home Secretary Sajid Javid announced Monday that the Conservative government was planning a major crackdown on child abuse online, and said that tech giants must do more to combat the problem.

In a speech made at the London headquarters of the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC), Javid said it was his "personal mission" to tackle crimes such as online grooming and live-streaming of sexual acts on minors.

"The growth of the internet has given potential offenders who previously may have had no access to children the opportunity to meet and groom and abuse victims online on gaming sites and on social media and to get access to more abuse material than ever before," he said.

The Home Secretary also also accused large internet companies of being "a long way from where they need to be."

"Restrictions that are supposed to keep our children safe online are either not being enforced or do not meet expectations," he said. "I am not just asking for change, I am demanding it."
