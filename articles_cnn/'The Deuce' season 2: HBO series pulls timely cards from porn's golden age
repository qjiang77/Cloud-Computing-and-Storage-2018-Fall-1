'The Deuce' season 2: HBO series pulls timely cards from porn's golden age|http://www.cnn.com/entertainment|http://www.cnn.com/2018/09/07/entertainment/the-deuce-season-2-review/index.html||2018-09-07|Brian Lowry||(CNN) HBO has quietly shed erotic programming from its late-night lineup, but there's still "The Deuce," a fascinating, high-class and timely drama, situated during the formative days of modern pornography but -- as filtered through that prism -- with a lot to say about where we are now.

Picking up five years after season one ended, the provocative series has gone from the long lines that greeted "Deep Throat" to what was unfolding in and around adult theaters -- during a slightly more evolved if still paleolithic era of New York smut -- when "Star Wars" and "Saturday Night Fever" filled more traditional venues.

That would be 1977, and the soundtrack -- with its disco-flavored rhythms -- reflects the time jump, while helping capture a particularly significant moment. Porn is becoming big business, entering what some saw as its "golden age." But efforts to produce more ambitious, even arty fare are met with resistance, during a period that predates AIDS but in which racial prejudice impacts those looking to get in the game, such as Larry (Gbenga Akinnagbe), a pimp contemplating a new career path.

Like other series set in the '60s and '70s ("Mad Men" being a prime example), "The Deuce" invites contemplating political issues of today by looking backward, including the state of gay rights, feminism and what would become the #MeToo movement 40 years ago.

A later episode contains a particularly compelling scene regarding the last of those topics, as Maggie Gyllenhaal's Candy -- who has made the transition from porn actress to director -- meets with a potential financier, who assumes that she'll accede to whatever he demands.
