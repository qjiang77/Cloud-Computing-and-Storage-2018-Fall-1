A pair of giant hands lift the ribbon-like Golden Bridge up in the air above Vietnam's Trường Sơn Mountains.

The shimmering structure emerges from the trees of Thien Thai garden in Ba Na Hills. Set more than 1,400m above sea level, the bridge incorporates eight spans and extends 150m long. Its green hands have been aged, as if they've been there for centuries.

Lobelia Chrysanthemums are planted along the latticed sides of the bridge, like purple embroidery. Opened in June, the bridge is reportedly part of a $2 billion project to accommodate tourists in the area.

The bridge was designed by TA Landscape Architecture in Ho Chi Minh City.

Ba Na Hills is a mountainside resort, established by French colonists in 1919. Close to the city of Da Nang, it once held some 200 villas but today, only a few ruins remain. Ba Na Hills now holds a Fantasy Park and a French-style village, with cobbled streets.
