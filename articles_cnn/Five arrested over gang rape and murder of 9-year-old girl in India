The girl was gang raped, strangled, her head wounded with an ax and her eyes gouged out, police said in a statement.

The attack was carried out by the girl's 14-year-old stepbrother and two of his friends "in presence and at the instance of her stepmother" according to police, who said the violence was due to a family dispute.

The girl's father's remarriage had led to a feud between with his first and second wives, police said.

"The acrimonious atmosphere, primarily for the reason of (the) second marriage of (the father) had been building up in the family over a period of time," said the statement.
