Review ordered into Australian mother convicted of killing her four children|http://www.cnn.com/australia|http://www.cnn.com/2018/08/22/australia/australia-folbigg-case-review-intl/index.html||2018-08-22|Euan Mckirdy||(CNN) A former chief judge will review the conviction of a woman described as Australia's worst female serial killer, who currently is serving a lengthy prison sentence for murdering her four children.

Described by Australian media as "Australia's most hated woman," Kathleen Megan Folbigg was convicted in 2003 of the murder of three of her children, and the manslaughter of her fourth.

The four children died between the ages of 19 days and 19 months, over a 10-year period from 1989.

After an appeal, she was sentenced to 30 years in prison, with a non-parole period of 25 years. Folbigg has always maintained her innocence.

The inquiry was opened on the basis of a petition submitted by Folbigg, which calls into question evidence of the deaths of the children and suggests that they could have died of natural causes, Attorney-General Mark Speakman said in a statement. The case will be reviewed by former chief district court judge, Reginald Blanch.

Folbigg's defence had claimed her babies were victims of sudden infant death syndrome.
